Off the back of strong commodity prices and the current confidence within agriculture, specifically in northern
NSW, Westpac is adding further support to assist local communities with an investment in people across the
district.

Westpac agribusiness regional general manager in Northern NSW, Hank MacInnes, says innovation in
agriculture continues to bring greater efficiencies to a high fixed cost business, which is driving confidence
among customers and adding new opportunities to the ones that currently exist.

"Despite fluctuations in market prices and climatic conditions across the state, commodity prices remain
strong, which is great for our local farmers and industries," he said. The bank made a recent hire, Tom
Chatfield, who will be based at Tamworth and brings with him 15 years of banking experience. Tom's ag
expertise, including a degree in Agricultural Science, will see him focus on the larger end of the scale farming
and beyond farm gate businesses.
