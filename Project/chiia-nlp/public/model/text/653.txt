There was never any doubt the Fastnet Rock colt from The Broken Shore would be the sales-topper at the
first Inglis Easter Sales held at the lavish Riverside stables set-up this week. One look at the colt took away
your breath. His coat was gleaming and he stood like a true aristocrat. Rightly so, considering his dam is a
half-sister to greats such as Redoute's Choice, Manhattan Rain and Platinum Scissors.

And not forgetting The Broken Shore's first foal Shoals has won twice in group 1 company and she was
bought for $1.9 million. Shoals is trained by Anthony Freedman, who also has her full-brother, the unraced
colt Tides. The Broken Shore is owned by John Messara and Jonathan Munz and both high-profile breeders
have kept large shares in the Fastnet Rock colt sold on Wednesday for $2.3 million.

Freedman was on a mission to buy - and ultimately train - the colt. "I think that knowing the family as well as I
do gave me the confidence to buy the youngster who sold as Lot 400," Freedman said. "He was the colt of
the year, in my opinion, and he will have a great future as a stallion. He is truly a magnificent individual."
Despite the hot conditions at the Warwick Farm stables, the Inglis-owned Riverside stables were applauded
by buyers and onlookers.The Book 1 sale was a massive success with Inglis boss Mark Webster stating it
was second only to the 2008 crop. The figures revealed:

- 335 yearlings sold for $116,457,000 - up 6 per cent from last year.

- An average of $347,634.

- 22 yearlings fetched seven-figure sums, with 71 lots selling for $500,000 or more.

- The 22 seven-figure yearlings were sired by eight stallions: Snitzel (7), I Am Invincible (5), Fastnet Rock (4),
Deep Impact (2), Redoute's Choice, Frankel, Pierro and Not A Single Doubt.

THE STALLIONS: The big three of Australian racing - Snitzel, I Am Invincible and Fastnet Rock - were again
to the fore this week. Snitzel was the leading stallion by aggregate with 41 lots amassing an amazing
$21,685,000, the highest-priced being $1.55 million for Milburn Creek's colt from Walk With Attitude. I Am
Invincible was second with a return of $18,650,000 for his 34 sellers, the highest being $1.4 million for The
Quarterback's half-brother from Gilgai Farm bought by Team Hawkes. Fastnet Rock was third with a gross
return of $16,625,000 and he produced the two top-priced lots at $2.3m and $1.8m to Freedman and George
Moore respectively. Fastnet Rock was the leading sire by average with three or more lots selling. His average
was $554,167 which narrowly edged out I Am Invincible ($548,529) and Snitzel ($528,902).

THE VENDORS: Arrowfield Stud romped home in this category for the third successive year, selling 31
yearlings for an amazing $18,285,000, an average of $589,194. The Messara-led farm sold seven
million-dollar horses with Shoal's full-brother topping the sale at $2.3m. Segenhoe Stud had a formidable
three days of selling with 19 lots fetching $7,506,000 and an average of $395,000. Kitchwin Hills celebrated
with two million-dollar-plus yearlings with the Snitzel x Go Indy Go colt selling to a syndicate formed by
Glenlogan Farm, Max Whitby and RIFA Mustang for $1.5m, and an I Am Invincible colt for $1m to the HK
Jockey Club.

played a huge role in the Easter Sales and was the biggest spender with nine purchases for an outlay of
$6,140,000. Gold is one of the most diligent lookers at major yearling sales worldwide and figured in the
purchase of two of the 22 million-dollar sellers. He went to $1.4m for the Snitzel x Tetsuko colt and $1m for a
Snitzel filly from Reply Churlish. Most of Shadwell's team will be trained by the David Hayes stable with South
African trainer Mike de Kock usually getting one or two of the purchases. The team of Gai Waterhouse,
Adrian Bott and Blue Sky Bloodstock came away with 15 yearlings for $5,250,000, including the $1.2m
Snitzel x Asscher colt in conjunction with renowned international buyer Kerri Radcliffe, and an I Am Invincible
colt from Eye For Fun for $1,050,000. The Hong Kong Jockey Club finished the sales with six lots at a cost of
$4.6m. The China Horse Club was active and Michael Wallace, its racing and breeding manager, was
responsible for eight purchases in partnership with a several clients. Their total cost was $3,190,000, with the
I Am Invincible-Hoss Amor colt being its only seven-figure buy. Wallace was to buy the Dissident colt (Lot 22)
from Assail who was involved in a mishap while parading before entering the sale ring. Inglis' allowed the colt
to be sold after the final lot on the first day of the sales following a veterinary inspection and Wallace went to
$800,000 to buy the handsome youngster. Wallace told Bloodlines he considered the Dissident colt one of
the best lots in the Easter catalogue, claiming his physical structure was outstanding and the vet's inspection
showed the incident in the parade ring caused no problems. James Harron, Chris Waller and Guy Mulcaster's
buys were limited but as has become customary they buy quality rather than quantity at the Easter Sales.
Harron signed for five lots for $4,430,000 - the two highest lots being colts by Redoute's Choice ($1.5m) and
Not A Single Doubt ($1,050,000). Waller and Mulcaster struck early on day one buying Lot 11, a filly by
Japanese sire Deep Impact, for $1.1m, and Lot 32, a Snitzel filly from Azmiyna bred by the Aga Khan, for
$1.3m. Waller and Mulcaster's total buys were four for $3,040,000.

Real Revolution

Newgate Farm has issued its 2018 stallion prices, and Russian Revolution joins Golden Slipper and Magic
Millions winner Capitalist as its top-priced stallion at $55,000. Russian Revolution, a magnificent individual by
Snitzel, has been booked out since Newgate announced his retirement. The China Horse Club is the major
shareholder in the sire and will be sending 30 of its best mares in his first stud season.
