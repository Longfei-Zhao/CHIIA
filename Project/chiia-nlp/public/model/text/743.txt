Resource	stocks	have	captured	a	lot	of	attention	on	the	ASX	today,	with	quarterly	reports
coming	though	in	the	mining	and	energy	sectors,	noted	Bell	Direct	analyst	Julia	Lee.

She	noted	that	the	US	reporting	season	is	also	a	factor	for	markets,	with	investors	looking	for
outlook	statements	from	companies	for	clues	as	to	where	the	US	economy	is	in	the	cycle.

Two	years	after	China	informally	tightened	capital	controls,	it	looks	to	be	targeting	the	use	of
foreign	listings	to	get	money	out	of	the	country,	a	development	which	has	already	begun	to
affect	some	of	the	26	mainland	stocks	listed	in	Australia.

In	response	to	a	query	by	the	Australian	Securities	Exchange,	the	Chongqing	based
Traditional	Therapy	Clinics	(TTC)	indicated	it	was	able	to	transfer	money	out	of	the	country,
but	only	to	pay	dividends	for	"non-Chinese	resident	shareholders".

China's	steel	futures	climbed	more	than	2	per	cent	on	Wednesday,	on	track	for	their	biggest
daily	gain	in	three	weeks,	after	the	country's	central	bank	announced	it	would	cut	the	cash
banks	hold	as	reserves.

The	People's	Bank	of	China	late	on	Tuesday	unexpectedly	said	it	would	cut	the	reserve
requirement	ratio	(RRR),	the	amount	of	cash	that	most	commercial	and	foreign	banks	must
hold	as	reserves	to	pay	back	medium-term	lending	facilities,	by	100	basis	points	for	most
commercial	banks.

Citi	took	a	look	at	the	oil	sector	and	the	winners	and	losers	across	its	global	coverage.

"We	are	not	bullish	oil	however	we	are	bullish	energy	equities,"	the	broker	said	.

China's	home	prices	rose	at	the	fastest	pace	in	three	months	in	March,	fuelled	by	gains	in
smaller	cities,	even	as	the	government	maintained	a	two-year	campaign	to	cool	the	housing
market.

New	home	prices	across	70	cities	gained	0.42	per	cent	from	a	month	earlier,	according	to
Bloomberg	calculations	based	on	Wednesday's	data	from	the	National	Bureau	of	Statistics.
That	compared	with	a	0.25	per	cent	increase	in	February.

Commonwealth	Bank	of	Australia	may	look	to	sell	down	70	per	cent	or	more	in	an	ASX	listing
of	its	$4	billion	global	asset	management	arm,	Joyce	Moullakis	reports.

A	divestment	of	70	per	cent	to	up	to	100	per	cent	is	not	out	of	the	question,	sources	told	The
Australian	Financial	Review.

AMP	shares	are	down	almost	7	per	cent	this	week	at	$4.45	after	executives	at	the	wealth
manager	faced	questions	at	the	Royal	Commission	into	the	financial	services	sector.

The	AFR's	James	Frost	writes	today	that	AMP	is	charging	thousands	of	unsuspecting	platform
users	for	advice	fees	despite	not	receiving	permission	from	the	underlying	customers	as
required	by	law.
