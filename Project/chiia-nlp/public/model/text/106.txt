0622 GMT - Bolstered by fresh gains in oil and metals prices, resources companies led another broad
advance for Australian stocks. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 settled 0.4% higher at 6084.5, reversing much
of Friday's decline that snapped a 5-day winning streak. Energy and materials each rose 0.8% today, with
heavily weighted BHP Billiton ahead by 1.5%. Meanwhile, a well-received F1H report from Westpac sent it up
0.8% also and Macquarie climbed a further 1.9% as analysts weighed in following Friday's FY beat. But Orica
slumped 6.4% after its 1H numbers. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

0609 GMT - International Flavors & Fragrances has reached a $6.3 billion cash-and-stock deal to acquire
Israeli-listed peer Frutarom just 3 months after announcing a plan to cut 5% of its workforce amid a 2-year
cost-cutting effort. IFF sees $145 million of savings by the 3rd year after the deal closes as well as
"substantial cross-selling opportunities to accelerate long-term profitable growth." IFF makes flavors and
fragrances found in an array of products and does most of its business outside the US. Separately, the
company reported bigger-than-expected 1Q growth and reiterated 2018 targets. IFF shares have fallen 6.9%
this year. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury)

0321 GMT - Hartleys expects Aurelia Metals to be net cash by the end of June following an unexpectedly
strong contribution from its new Peak Mines asset. Aurelia Mines said cash from Peak Mines totalled A$36
million in the 3 months through March, confounding Hartleys which had expected a minimal boost in the
quarter. The bull thinks Aurelia Metals currently has net debt of A$8 million after factoring in remaining costs
tied to the Peak Mines acquisition, having previously anticipated net debt of A$30 million outcome.

0205 GMT - Kenanga turns bullish on Malaysian plastic-packaging maker SLP even while 1Q core-profit
growth of 13% merely met expectations with shares having nearly halved this year on margin concerns amid
higher resin costs. The broker believes most earnings risk has been priced into the stock, which it still has a
MYR1.30 target on. Shares closed Friday at MYR1. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com; @yantoultra)

0202 GMT - As Chinese raw-coal output has been recovering, demand has been solid and is starting to eat
into port inventories, says Argonaut Securities. That makes it upbeat about broad price improvements. The
price of thermal coalat China's Qinhuangdao Portis up some 2% the past 10 days, Argonaut notes. That as
Australian thermal coal jumped 7% last week. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

0109 GMT - Orica is shaping up to have its worst day in 6 months following the Aussie explosives firm's F1H
report. Shares in November also slumped following downbeat earnings news, which also came with a
downbeat outlook. Guidance, though, wasn't changed today. Shares are down 6% after having popped 12%
in April, putting them at 2 1/2-week lows. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

0056 GMT - Although UOB Kay Hian remains bullish on Malaysia's building-materials sector after last
month's drop in steel-rebar prices, it's become less optimistic on the steel segment, in part on looming supply
growth in 2H. The investment bank also believes that impacts from industry consolidation in China is limited
as planned 2018 production cuts are near their target. UOB's stock targets slide 20% on Ann Joo to MYR3.60
and 13% on Choo Bee to MYR2.70, but it remains bullish on both. Ann Joo is down 1/4 this year while Choo
Bee is flat. (yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com; @yantoultra)

and despite Tesla's talk about tweaking technology to use less cobalt. The investment bank thinks the
automaker was trying to distance itself from concerns about cobalt supplies, which mainly come from the
politically unstable Democratic Republic of Congo. Canaccord also notes that Tesla only made up 8% of
electric vehicles last year. "The supply-and-demand outlooks for both cobalt and lithium are very positive
based on burgeoning demand for EVs and energy-storage systems." (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com;
