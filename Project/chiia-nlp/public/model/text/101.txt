ALAN ROBERT SINDEL, CEO, MD AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CSR LIMITED: We're good to go?
Thanks. Well, good morning, everyone. It's now 9:30, and welcome to the CSR results presentation for the
year ending March 2018. Thank you for those of us joining us here in the room and also those on the call.
And of course, thank you to Andrew Scott from Morgan Stanley for hosting us. Always appreciate it, Andrew.
So thanks again for that.

Just quickly on the agenda. We'll -- as with prior years, we'll move swiftly through the presentation to leave
plenty of time for questions. I'll provide a brief overview of the results before handing over to CFO, David Fallu,
to talk through the detailed financial performance. And then I'll come back with some commentary around
each of the operating business units.

So on to Slide 4. Just before looking at the headline results for the group, important that we acknowledge the
4,000 employees in CSR who have made this possible. It's -- we -- I always say, we just dole out the
numbers. It's the efforts of all of those people that's really delivered what we consider to be a very good
result. We've continued our track record of growth in earnings, improving for the fifth consecutive year. This is
actually the highest earnings in 11 years, and earnings are now higher than when CSR owned the Sugar
business. So in my view, a good illustration of what focus can achieve.

We have maintained our consistent strategy over the last 6 years, which has enabled us to capitalize on the
strength of the residential construction markets in Australia, while at the same time building and reinvesting in
our portfolio of leading building products. We are now the #1 player in the majority of the product segments in
which we compete and, not surprisingly, delivering superior returns.

Property is also a major contributor to the group, and we are accelerating our development of future projects.
Now we have greater flexibility of operational footprint, particularly here in Western Sydney. Dividend for the
year is up 4%. The utilization of our tax losses, a few years earlier than expected, has enabled us to increase
our franking from 50% to 75%.

So moving on to Slide 5. I think this is the slide -- most important slide in many ways to me, because it's the
reshaping of our earnings profile and the significant improvement in the return on funds employed over the
last 6 years, and that's really the overarching message at the group level.

In 2018, Building Products and Viridian now represent 2/3 of our earnings from around 55% 6 years ago. The
proportion of earnings from Aluminium relative to our core Building Products and Property business will
continue to decline now that the new electricity contract at Tomago has kicked in.

Along with growth in our Building Products earnings, we expect greater return from our large Property
portfolio over the next 5 years, and I'll show you a slide which illustrates that shortly.

Group return on funds has improved, as I said, from 5% in 2013 to over 23% today. And this improvement
has come in 3 main areas: solid improvement in our Lightweight Systems business, including Gyprock and
Hebel; growth in our Bradford insulation business and in a number of adjacent energy efficiency segments;
and our acquisitions in bricks and AFS, which have significantly increased overall Building Products earnings.
All these different pieces of work have fundamentally improved the underlying performance and, in my view,
made the company much more resilient to movements in both housing starts and the aluminum price.

So at that point, I'll pause and hand over to David to take you through the detail of the numbers.

comments. I'd also like to thank the team at CSR who are responsible for delivering and reporting the results
you see here today. And from my perspective, the really pleasing aspect of our results has been the
continuation of our improved performance across almost all aspects of our Building Products portfolio,
providing a more diversified and higher quality of earnings for CSR.

So if we turn to Slide 7, it summarizes our profit and loss for the year. In terms of revenue, it was up 6% for
the year to $2.6 billion. The benefit of this revenue growth, together with strong operational improvements
across the business, flowed to earnings. And as a result, EBIT before significant items was $324 million, up
9%. Our effective tax rate was 28.4%, reflecting the benefit of distributions from associated companies and
property sales during the year. And it would be our expectation the effective tax rate would be at a similar
level for next year.

Net profit after tax was up strongly to $213 million, an increase of 16%. We reported significant items for the
period of $24 million after tax. The main contributors to these costs was the sale of 3 Viridian Glass sites and
associated restructuring and the one-off raw material supply disruption in Gyprock with the closure of the port
at (inaudible). Accordingly, net profit after tax post significant items was $189 million, up 6%.

Looking at the EBIT performance by division on Slide 8. You can see that Building Products was up 6% for
the year to $214 million. As Rob will talk to, there were strong performances across the broad base of our
Building Products portfolio, and this has enabled us to continue investing in long-term growth initiatives such
as our digital platform CSR Connect, offsite construction systems and expansions within our AFS and Hebel
facilities as they increase their capacity and grow ahead of the market.

In Viridian, EBIT was $3.5 million. The Commercial division experienced operational issues, and it was
unable to capitalize on the investment Viridian has made to capture greater share of this market.

In Aluminium, EBIT was down 15% to $80 million. Operationally, the business is performing well and we've
benefited from higher realized pricing, but this has been more than offset by costs associated with the new
electricity contract and higher raw material costs.

As we highlighted a few weeks ago, $7 million of the Stage 5 settlements at Chirnside Park were delayed by
2 weeks, and this completed last month. Despite this, Property delivered an EBIT result of $48 million, its
highest level in 6 years.

On our cash performance, which can be seen on Slide 9, operating cash flow was down 6% for the year,
which was impacted by the lower Aluminium earnings. The overall increase in working capital supported our
sales growth and supplemented our domestic manufacturing and distribution capability with the import of new
products.

Looking at the Property business, you can see the business generated net inflows of $17 million compared to
an outflow -- compared to an inflow of $10 million last year. Cash proceeds of $52 million from the Rosehill
property sale will be received in December '19, and we continue to operate on that site under lease
arrangements.

As a result, we exited the year with $14.3 million in net debt. This puts us in a very strong position to continue
investing in growth opportunities and our pipeline of Property projects.

If we turn to the next slide, in terms of capital expenditure, excluding property and acquisitions, we spent $83
million during the year. This is in line with depreciation and amortization and is at the higher level -- and is at
a higher level to previous years due to the investment in our Hebel and AFS facilities.

Including Property, total capital expenditure for the year was $121 million, an increase of approximately $27
million on the previous year, excluding acquisitions.

The Hebel expansion project continues into YEM19. Our expectation is that capital expenditure, excluding
that project, property and acquisitions will be approximately 75% of depreciation.

And with that, I'll now hand over to Rob, and I'll come back for questions at the end.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Thanks, David. So let's turn to the key drivers of that performance in individual
business units, and I'll start with some of the macro indicators. So I'm on Slide 12 here, and basically, these
are illustration of the residential market. And it's encouraging to see that the East Coast detached market
continues its resilience, with commencements down 1% on a 2 -- on a 1-quarter -- sorry, 2-quarter lag basis.
A lot of speculation about high-rise, and that market's down 12% in commencements terms, but interestingly,
the New South Wales market continues to perform well with starts actually up.

Page2of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.The important one for me is the chart on the right-hand side, which is detached building approvals by state,
with New South Wales at the bottom, Victoria, Queensland and the other states grouped together. You'll see
that -- you will have seen that last week's March ABS approvals, at an annualized basis of 120,000. So starts
in detached are actually growing again. On the East Coast, they're up about 5%. So that did surprise us, but it
shows the underlying demand for housing. Alterations and additions remained pretty healthy, with some of
the activity actually being captured in the knockdown-rebuild market.

Looking at some of the other drivers for us on Slide 13. The Australian nonresidential market is up 9% with
some good approvals data coming through in commercial construction. This is consistent with what we're
seeing in the commercial market, particularly in offices, hotels and the retail sector. During the year, we
worked on a number of landmark projects, including the Commonwealth Games Village and the new Perth
Optus Stadium, with a number of health-related projects also in the pipeline.

On the right-hand side -- on the right-hand chart, you can see that New Zealand housing continues to perform
well, particularly in the North Island, both in Auckland and Wellington.

On Slide 14, as David said, Building Products revenue is up 6% to a record $1.7 billion. Return on funds
continues to improve, reaching a new high of almost 24%.

The EBIT margin is flat year-on-year. But actually, we're pretty happy with that, as we have offset significant
energy cost increases of another $9 million this year. Forward electricity prices are now falling, so we should
recover some of this in our margins next year.

In Viridian, we are seeing continued improvement from our traditional core businesses which service the
residential market. In this segment, we have largely offset higher energy costs through price increase as we
have done in Building Products. Where the business has struggled is in the commercial market, targeting
larger double-glaze units. Now I'll stress this is a new business with us, and we see significant opportunity in
this sector.

During the year, higher-than-anticipated orders led to operational issues and significant increases in costs at
our recently commissioned factory at Ingleburn in New South Wales. Broadly, we were not capable of
meeting demand and the expectations of our customers. We increased resourcing to meet this demand, and
this incurred us higher costs. We've seen an improvement in performance over the last few months as we
built capability and simplified the operating process.

New Zealand is also delivering improved earnings. Really in New Zealand, following the consolidation of the 3
plants in Auckland. You'll remember, last year, that was one of the key challenges we had with the
consolidation in the results last year. We're also encouraged by the increasing demand for high-margin and
high-performance glass in both commercial and residential constructions.

In Victoria, now over 60% of our revenue is from double-glazing, which is linked to the legislative changes to
improve energy efficiency in housing and commercial.

In New South Wales, new basic legislation, which came into effect in July this year, should also improve --
sorry, July last year, should also improve demand for high-performance glass.

Now moving to Aluminium on Slide 16. Sales volumes, again, were up 1%, consistent with the trend we've
seen over the last few years. Australian dollar pricing was up 10%, which reflects the continued improvement
in U.S. dollar pricing and higher premiums.

As we highlight at the half year, supply constraints for raw materials in China, including coke and pitch have
increased cost by around $12 million. At this stage, we do not expect this increase to materially increase next
year. Energy costs were also up $34 million for the 5 months with the commencement of the new electricity
contract, which included some spot electricity purchases. These spot volumes have now been added to our
long-term contract with AGL.

The energy costs include $7 million linked to what's called delivered coal pass-through costs. This is the cost
that can fluctuate but historically has not impacted Tomago. It's been in our previous and in our current
contract. And predominantly, this is driven by the changes in demand for the New South Wales electricity by
the closure of Hazelwood in Victoria. This meant higher-priced delivered coal to New South Wales generators
as they struggled to access coal. We'll come back to that, I'm sure, in questions.

The aluminum market on Slide 17. You'll be aware of the recent sharp increases in aluminum prices following
U.S. tariff announcements. We've taken the opportunity to increase our hedging over the last few weeks as
LME prices rose sharply. You'll see on the table, we are now 74% hedged in YEM19, and this excludes the
premium for delivery, which has also increased as a result of the U.S. tariff announcements.

Page3of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.While there has been a global increase in input costs like energy and coke, pleasingly, there's good
underlying demand for aluminum globally, coupled with a global supply balance. This is being reflected in the
steady increase in price since April 2016.

Looking at Property on Slide 18. As David said, the Rosehill site was the major contributor to the result. This
is a good illustration of the growth in land values in Western Sydney as these traditional industrial sites are
revalued to residential or commercial developments.

Chirnside Park continues to do very well, and at this stage, we have secured almost 90% of the expected
sales for this project. As you know, in April, we announced the sale of the first stage of Horsley Park here in
Sydney, which is expected to be recorded in the second half of the year. Development is now progressing on
Stage 2 at Horsley Park. Looking ahead, the rezoning approval process for Schofields is on track and is
expected to be completed by the end of 2018.

So what we've done on Slide 19 is really map out those projects for the previous -- for the prior 5 years and
the next 5 years to help the market understand what's in the pipeline. But going back over the last 5 years,
our guidance was to generate EBIT of $15 million to $20 million per year. What we've actually achieved is
average earnings of $26.7 million over that period. So looking ahead, we're also working on rezoning several
projects illustrated in that pipeline. At this -- as this process is completed, we'll be able to provide longer-term
guidance of future property earnings.

Some comments on the market and our thoughts on the outlook. So looking to the future. For us, it's really a
story about population growth. That remains the key fundamental driver of housing demand, particularly on
the East Coast of Australia. We're actually seeing Western Australia and Queensland starting to grow again
after population fell for a couple of -- for nearly 2 years in Western Australia. And in our view, this has driven a
structural shift in demand for housing. The pent-up demand was met by the unprecedented levels of high-rise
apartment constructions, illustrated by the red line on the left-hand side. In contrast to this, there has been
stability in the detached approvals, shown by the red line on -- sorry, shown by the yellow line on the chart.
And fundamentally, this gives us confidence in our Building Products volumes for the year ahead.

A couple of key points I'd like to make on Slide 22. The first is the breakdown of our end market exposure.
There are clearly some lead indicators pointing to a moderation in higher-density construction, and this sector
represents 12% of our Building Products exposure. Secondly, the engine room of growth, as I said, is on the
-- is in the Eastern states, and these are the states where we have high market share in multiple product
categories. The chart on the right-hand side shows our growth in revenue relative to a weighted index of work
done. From 2007 to 2014, we pretty much tracked the market, whereas in the last 4 years, we would argue
that we've grown above trend.

So finally, a comment on our strategy on Slide 23. So what's the differentiator for CSR that -- why do
customers choose to do business with us? We would consider it to be our consistent strategy across multiple
product categories and our work on a number of initiatives that support the building and construction industry.
These include development of enhanced digital platforms, new products that grow our core brands, building
organic growth ideas using our lean start-up methodology and also expanding our business portfolio into
adjacencies like acoustic insulation and offsite construction.

And the final slide, our outlook for the year ahead. So in Building Products and Viridian, recent building
approvals remain strong with detached housing start at their highest level in 2 years. This supports the
current level of activity for the year ahead. Viridian's operational performance in Australia and New Zealand
has improved in recent months, with the business on track to improve earnings in the year ahead.

Currently, 74% of net aluminum exposure is hedged for YEM19, but earnings will be impacted by the full year
effect of higher power-related costs I spoke to earlier. 2 Property transactions were announced in the first
week of YEM19, totaling EBIT of approximately $37 million. This includes Stage 5 of Chirnside Park and the
10 hectares of surplus industrial land at Horsley Park.

So I'll pause there, and thanks again for all your support of CSR. And as David and I reiterated earlier, thank
you to the employees and all the work they've done and the team to pull the results together.

I'll throw it open to questions and might start with the room.

Questions and Answers

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Mr. Thackray, you're back. Andrew, you get -- host goes first.

ANDREW GEOFFREY SCOTT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Andrew Scott, Morgan Stanley. Rob, I know you love to talk about the weather, but we did have very
favorable conditions across Eastern Australia, maybe with exception of Queensland. How much do you feel

Page4of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.that benefited this result? And if we're looking forward, given, I guess, normal conditions next year, what
should we be thinking about as a bit of a tailwind -- headwind there? Sorry.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I think, over the year, it sorts itself out, quite frankly. It's either the season. The wet
season comes earlier or later, and you go with the swings. Actually, the bigger impact this year, particularly
on Viridian, was where Easter fell last year relative to this year. So I think it was about 16 working days
effectively last year versus 19 this year. So that's had a significant impact just in the April month. But we tend
not to comment on the weather because it moves around, and it'll be wet somewhere and it won't be wet
somewhere else. Favorable conditions on the East Coast where we have our major exposure.

ANDREW GEOFFREY SCOTT: And you did mention energy cost across the Building Products business.
Can you just let us know where you are with the various businesses in terms of electricity and gas? I know,
with gas, I think you locked in on 2- to 3-year deals last year. So what's able to move and correct to maybe
some more favorable prices over the next 12 months?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Thank you. Yes, so we had about $9 million of additional costs in Building Products
this year and about $4 million of additional costs in Viridian. So $13 million in total. Putting that into
perspective, it was $75 million, and I think it's now $107 million is the total. So over that 2-year period, so
that's significant uplift. And we've covered that in the margin, which is the pleasing piece. As you said, we've
locked in gas prices. There are some CPI increases in Victoria and New South Wales, but they're locked in
for the next 2 or 3 years, depending on the contract. What we did with electricity, when the price started to run
up, we actually started hedging electricity. So we're running off -- but pretty short term, quarters ahead. We'll
get the benefit next year as electricity prices start to reduce, which I alluded to in the presentation.

ANDREW GEOFFREY SCOTT: And on that, on gas. You -- I think you told us that you were oil-linked, but
you'd hedge that out, is that correct?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: We have, that's right.

ANDREW GEOFFREY SCOTT: And just finally, plasterboard and industry dynamics there, you've obviously
had some capacity out of in Queensland. How are you seeing the market behavior now that we've had that
running for a little while?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: The key dynamic for me is not a lot of change in customer behavior, which is
always the concern. A bit of pressure on pricing, as you can imagine, as that capacities come online. It's
given one of our competitors the opportunity to close their plant in Sydney and do some maintenance, so you
haven't really seen the effect of that. New South Wales and Victorian markets continue to be very strong. So I
think the impact is probably more a little bit on pricing than it is necessarily on volumes at this stage.

SIMON THACKRAY, RESEARCH ANALYST, CLSA LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Simon Thackray from
CLSA. Just a couple of questions if I can, Rob. Capacity constraints in the industry, we're seeing housing
approvals, obviously, a flat really year-on-year up to March 2027. The pipeline of work to be done is pretty
strong. Looking at the actual delivery quarter-after-quarter, the whole industry across the board is delivering
about the same amount of volume. It feels like we're capacity constrained. Should we be getting more price in
this industry? And what's stopping us from getting price in the industry? That's the first question. And do you
see, basically with those leading indicators now effectively softening, which you've pointed to, particularly in
multifamily, is [19] the best we're going to probably see out of the Building Products portfolio?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: So in terms of price, always a debate about -- at the headline level, I think each
data is different. Obviously, pressure on pricing plasterboard is more, and the price has probably gone
backward a little bit rather than forward. And the capacity constraints aren't on every month of every year.
The capacity constraints are in the long month of -- as you run up with that [sales] particularly in New South
Wales and Victoria, very strong months in October, November, December. So you might offset pricing at
some stage. It isn't as though the industry is completely sold out. We were short of plasterboard with issues
with GRA. We've been able to rebuild that capacity. So I don't think there's any inherent shortages in the
industry; more shortages of trade than anything.

SIMON THACKRAY: That's really what I was referring to. The capacity constraint is actually on the labor side
and the ability to install. Is that the -- because you've got -- you've mentioned it before, half-on-half, that
you've still got slight capacity or available capacity. So is that the inhibitor to price?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I think that's a natural cap on sales levels. It probably would be higher and we'd be
more constrained if the industry could build more. The second part of your question on, is this as good as it
gets? I don't know -- I don't think so. I mean, in terms of the detached approvals are going up again. Australia
continues to grow. It's now 25 million, the population. 10 years ago, it was 20 million. So who knows what it
looks like in another 5 years? We'll go through some times where interest rates increase. I just -- as you saw
from the budget last night, the economic indicators are quite positive, employment numbers are good, interest
rates don't look like they're going up. So it's a bit boring, Simon, but it's a bit more of the same, I think.

Page5of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.SIMON THACKRAY: Yes, it's all right. Boring's okay sometimes. And just remind me the profitability, the
relative profitability of detached across the portfolio versus a multifamily start so that we can get a sensitivity.
Because if we do have that ongoing drive in detached, what's the relative profitability across the portfolio?
And I appreciate geographic mix changes, but broadly, is it a function of...

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: The margins aren't that different. Although in a commercial project where there's a
lot of volume, people will chase that, and the margin might drop by a couple of percentage points at the EBIT
level. But on the mix of things, commercial and residential are pretty similar. Where we like the residential
detached is we just get so much more volume from a detached start than we do from a multifamily start.

SIMON THACKRAY: That's clear. And Rob, just shifting gears to Aluminium. Can you just remind us, the
alumina linkage, when do we see a change or potential change in the contract window? Is that reset -- I
mean, obviously, now alumina is, for various reasons, the linkage is up in the mid-20% mark. I think,
historically, you've been paying -- I know you don't disclose it, but we all guess somewhere between 12% and
14%. If you're hedged out in the future, does there -- is there an impact on margin if that resets materially
higher?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: We're a little higher than 12% or 14%. The contract we're in now got to what we
would call market prices, so they're embedded in our numbers. The 24%, I think, is driven by the sanctions
and all, but it bounces around from 16% to 18%. That's not far away from where we are. The contract
concludes in 2020, January 2020. So we will have needed to negotiate. You can imagine, Mark and the team
are in the throes of that. Over the next 18, 20 months, we'll renegotiate that contract. What you're seeing at
the moment is issues with Hydro in Brazil. Their alumina smelter is being shut down. The Rosehill effect, I
think that'll work through -- its way through the system in the next few months. And we're having discussions
with potential suppliers including Rio over that period.

SIMON THACKRAY: Really. And then just finally, you can't go through a result of your balance sheet without
asking about M&A and capital return, and I mean, dull, dull, dull. I get all that.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Thanks, Simon. I'll take that as a compliment.

SIMON THACKRAY: What are we thinking about strategically? I mean, I know I've seen the broad strategic
outlook but what are we thinking now with balance sheet and cash flows are good and everything is kind of
boring but steady.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I think the Bricks -- more of the same. The Bricks acquisition, what do we call it?
John, you had a term for it, incrementalism. Logical incrementalism, which to me makes a lot of sense.

SIMON THACKRAY: That should appear in the slide somewhere.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I beg your pardon?

SIMON THACKRAY: That should appear in the slide somewhere.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: And I think what that means is Bricks opportunities, opportunities in AFS. We've got
a big runway in AFS. We've got a runway in terms of offsite construction. We've won our first project in our
faÃ§ades business which we think provides opportunity. Do we have the big acquisition that we got a target
on? No, we don't.

PETER STEYN, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Peter Steyn from Macquarie. Rob, maybe just
honing in very briefly on capital management thought process as opposed to M&A in the context of the
balance sheet as it stands.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: David, you want to? You're hiding there.

DAVID FALLU: I think from a capital management perspective, the main aim that we've been looking at is in
terms of ensuring we've got the flexibility to continue our investment in our operational growth. I guess the
other aspect as well is that we look at the cash flow timing versus the revenue timing from Property sales.
We'll actually move into a, as you can see from those projects that's Rob alluded to in the slide, we'll actually
move into a net outflow for Property next year. So with that combined with the investment in Hebel, combined
with the continuous investment in the balance of our business, that's where we see that the best bang for
buck. I guess secondly, on the dividend side of things, we're obviously moving to a higher level of franking.
We're now in a tax payable position, so that gives us a little bit more opportunity on the dividend side moving
forward as well.

PETER STEYN: That's useful. And then, if I could just put together some of your comments around Building
Products. You've spoken about essentially a sustained level of activity. But in the context of a little bit more
price growth, some tailwinds from a cost point of view, one would think that, broadly speaking, you're

Page6of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.expecting a slightly better profit outcome in the year ahead in that business. I don't want to pin you to
something, but just curious on your thoughts in terms of that thought process.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: It's a bit early to -- we never sort of give guidance at this stage. The first month was
positive in terms of volume. The years are quite long. So we'll give you more guidance at the AGM and then
at the half.

PETER STEYN: And then maybe just last question on Viridian. Rob, at what point do you make a tough call
in this business given that you're still battling with returns in the operation? You're obviously hopeful that
commercial would come through and value-added products will sell through but just curious in your thoughts
there.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes, up until, actually, 18 months ago, we were on a very good trajectory. And 2
things in the previous year, which were basically we called out WA and some of those regional sites and our
performance in New Zealand where we really structurally changed the business. The pleasing thing about
that was we dealt with closures in Western Australia, Darwin and Cairns, and we dealt with New Zealand.
And actually, we're getting the delta out of New Zealand now which we -- and these things always take longer
than you expect. And I think that's one of the frustrations for the Viridian team is they want to deliver those
things quickly. But the reality is they generally take longer. The second part was the commercial business is a
whole new business. And starting that from scratch, putting in the equipment, training the people,
understanding how it used the kit is actually challenging. You want to hit the ground running but it actually
takes -- that usually takes a little bit more time. So they were the 2 issues, that commercial construction --
sorry, in this year, commercial construction plus the real hit of energy costs on the float plant. Interestingly,
with the fall in the dollar, looks like some of those customers are coming back to the float plant. So I think
we're disappointed about the last 2 years, but we've got great belief in the future of the Viridian business. We
might go to the phone.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brook Campbell-Crawford from
JPMorgan.

BROOK CAMPBELL-CRAWFORD, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just
one for Bricks and I appreciate the remarks around earnings being higher in the year. But can you provide an
idea of volume growth, price increases for that product -- or that business rather for the year?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes, I can. Volumes were actually pretty steady. They grew in New South Wales
and Victoria and went backwards a little bit in Queensland. And price was up about 5%. They -- that was the
one that had the biggest impost of gas increases, particularly in Victoria. So they're the fundamentals.

BROOK CAMPBELL-CRAWFORD: And then I suppose a similar question for Gyprock. Just to confirm, did
you mention earlier that prices went backwards for Gyprock? And then if you can maybe quantify the
comment around higher volumes in Gyprock as well?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes. Similar trend in insulation and plasterboard with price up about 2%, 1% to 2%.
Volumes up single digits in both of those. Insulation probably the strongest at about 8%, 9% growth. So I
didn't call out prices went backwards in plasterboard. I said in Queensland more pricing pressure.

BROOK CAMPBELL-CRAWFORD: Okay, on the CapEx in the Property business. Can you provide us with
an idea of the level of investments you expect to put into that Property business each year to kind of generate
your targeted level of earnings?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes, so I think in terms of the way we look at managing the Property business is to
effectively have it self funding in the way we stage developments in sales within that particular business. I
guess what we're seeing next year is given the level of project developments that we've got, that will move to
a net outflow. So overall for the year, we had an investment of around $38 million in Property CapEx. But for
next -- but resulted in an overall inflow to the business. Next year, we'll expect that to move to an outflow
position. Does that answer your question?

BROOK CAMPBELL-CRAWFORD: Yes, perfect.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Peter Wilson from Credit Suisse.

PETER WILSON, ASSOCIATE, CRÃ©DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I mean, once again called
out a strong result, a strong growth in the Hebel and AFS. Just give us a feel for what the outlook looks for
that business given you've got capacity coming in line in both those business. And potentially, if I understand
correctly, and maybe they will feel the softness in multi-res a little bit more than some of your other products.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes, I think -- although they're in the same segment they've got slightly different
drivers. Hebel at the moment is capacity constrained. We're actually importing about 25,000 cubic meters of

Page7of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.product to satisfy customer demand. So -- and that's obviously volume that will go into the new plant. There's
2 pieces to the new plant. There's actually taking 30-year-old technology and rebuilding, so treat some of it as
stay in business and also giving the ability to expand capacity. So we might see New South Wales, multi-res
come off. That's Hebel's strongest market. But we think if that does happen, it's a short-term issue, not a
long-term issue. Demand for housing, demand for multifamily in Sydney, I can't see slowing over the longer
term. So that's, from a Hebel point of view, whether you get your timing exactly right with these things doesn't
really matter. We're looking at it in a much longer investment cycle than that. The second part of AFS is it's
got -- we're finding penetration of that product into segments we didn't expect. So in the sense that we
thought it was basement commercial applications and apartments. Actually, we're seeing it in more and more
townhouse developments, basement developments in single-family dwellings in blocks where there's steep
elevations, you're getting more and more penetration of the products. So I think it's got a much different
pipeline -- it's got a much different runway to Hebel. The decision for us is we're now adding capacity in
Sydney. The next decision we got to make is where do we add the next capacity in the Australian network.

PETER WILSON: Okay, great. And coming on to the Aluminium business. You called out a bit of a change to
the structure, I guess, of your electricity cost or your contract there. So I think you said you rolled in some
spot volumes into the contract and also had a coal cost pass-through. Can you just give us some more color
on exactly how that -- both of those mechanisms work?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes. So when we entered into the new contract, it didn't cover all of our volume.
And I think we talked about a small -- relatively small percentage at the half. The opportunity under the new
contract was to roll that -- to go and find a better price for that or roll it into the new contract. When that was
up for grabs, the price was $100 per megawatt in New South Wales, so we've rolled that into the new
contract. So there's no -- I think there was about $4 million mark of additional cost in spot purchases during
that period. The new news for us is the coal pass-through. And as late as November and December, AGL
said, "No coal pass-through, no coal pass-through." What actually happened is, as I said Hazelwood came
out of the system in Victoria. That put additional demand for electricity from New South Wales. They went and
bought coal from further away than their traditional sources. We paid the delivered cost to the power station
and that flows through as what's called the past coal -- coal pass-through, and we pay our proportion of that,
and that's the $7 million we talked about in that period. That could go on for the full 12 months. We're in
discussions with AGL about what's this going to be and they're saying, "Well, demand is up and we're going
to need to buy more coal." But each of us know electricity generation from coal looks under pressure,
particularly with the addition of solar and wind. So we don't know, but we expect that to pass through over the
next -- to be a short-term issue over the next year or so.

PETER WILSON: Okay, great. And can you give us just the other, well, the other $9 million that you've called
out in Aluminium for a higher pot relining and reduced depreciation. Just maybe what we should expect
coming to next year, is that going to be anything similar?

DAVID FALLU: Yes, look. That's a mix of operational improvement in dividends from previous CapEx. In
terms of moving forward, we'd see that at a similar level next year. So we wouldn't be expecting the same
delta next year on a bridge year-on-year, if that's your question.

PETER WILSON: Okay, but you do expect some continued operational improvements. It's just not to that
size.

DAVID FALLU: Correct, correct. We won't get the same level because there's a one-off depreciation benefit
as a result of previous CapEx.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Keith Chau from Evans & Partners.

KEITH CHAU, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, EVANS & PARTNERS PTY. LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION:
Just a few questions. First one Rob, just on plasterboard. I think you mentioned pricing dynamics in
Queensland but tough in New South Wales. It's been okay given one of the competitors have actually taken
capacity offline for a bit of CapEx spend or maintenance CapEx. Just wondering from your perspective, as we
look into the year ahead, is that -- those plants come back online, are you expecting a bit more pressure in
New South Wales from a pricing perspective? I guess then following to that, is the expectation for overall
prices for YEM19 to be flat?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I think in plasterboard, it's a tough one to -- we've budgeted for price increases.
We've also budgeted for some reduction in volumes in New South Wales as a consequence of what you're
saying. The -- how that all flows out over the year is the $64,000 question. I think the fundamental business is
in good shape. We've all added capacity over the year whether it's us or Boral or Knauf. The market has
grown substantially. I forget the size of the plasterboard market. Now it's about $70 million whereas 10 years
ago, it was $55 million. So it's a growing market that needed more capacity. You either just move through
those periods of who's adding it and when.

Page8of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.KEITH CHAU: Okay. And then your comment around the non-residential approvals, the underlying data looks
pretty strong, as you mentioned, and there's potentially a bit more project work to come online in the coming
year. Given the significance and size of some of the projects you called out, so the Commonwealth Games
being one of them. Do you think that the pipe -- there's enough work in a pipeline to replace those larger
projects in the coming year?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Yes. With all of these segments, there's winners and losers. If you back the right
horse, you're well positioned. If you don't, you're the opposite. But I think, the commercial and non-res sector
tends to follow the residential cycle. And in terms of population growth, we build the houses, then we need
the commercial. All the investment in infrastructure, although we're not a big player, it opens up different
tracks of lands and gives us opportunity. So I think it all goes to the construction mix, all goes to the demand
for services. So that's got to be good for us. I think the growth in age care, health care, generally in hospitals
or age care facilities are good for us as well because you get good penetration of our products, Hebel, AFS,
Bricks, plasterboard, insulation, all those products go into that sector.

KEITH CHAU: Okay, maybe just one final and pretty broad question around price versus cost. Given the quite
a few different products within the building products as mentioned now. I was wondering, is there an
expectation internally, or what's been budgeted for, that price increases this year will indeed exceed cost
inflation?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Always our objective is to beat cost inflation through 2 means; either price increase
higher than your cost go up or operational cost down. And some of those -- so the businesses that have got
price increase, plasterboard, Bradford bricks that I talked about, we haven't seen a price increase in roofing
because it's under different competitive threats. We haven't seen price increase in Hebel because we're
protecting our position against imports, and AFS we're growing -- volumes are up 35%. So net-net, there's
different dynamics. I think from CSR's point of view, the pleasing part is $35 million of energy cost increases
have been [covered]. The trick for us will be if there are some unwind in energy cost is making sure we don't
give that back.

KEITH CHAU: I guess the other point really is [you burn] more scope for further cost reductions within the
businesses themselves.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: You've always got scope for cost reduction, whether it's in your supply chain, your
warehouse and distribution. We're running projects in each of our businesses along those lines. So that's just
part of doing business and anyone who isn't looking for cost reduction isn't probably doing what they should
do. It's challenging to deliver those when you're volumes are growing because people are usually running
pretty fast. But that's what management's required to do.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Sophie Spartalis from Merrill Lynch.

SOPHIE SPARTALIS, VP AND SENIOR RESOURCES ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Can we just get a progress at the Ingleburn site and what can we expect from an offsite over the
next few years, please?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: From this -- the Viridian or velocity.

SOPHIE SPARTALIS: From your offsite construction that you called out in your commentary?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Okay, there's 2 pieces to that offsite construction. One is the residential walling
business that we call velocity. Still work in progress. We've had various discussions with different builders.
Everyone thinks it's a good idea, but actually people committing is a different story. When they're busy, they
tend not to change their process. The positive around that is actually we have very -- the intangible benefit
around that with our customers is they see us as the innovators in the industry. And I think we shouldn't
underestimate the benefit of that. The second one is the in-closed business, which we actually set up in Port
Kembla in an old BlueScope warehouse. That's a faÃ§ade system in commercial construction. We've won of
our first job at ANU with Lendlease, which is actually a faÃ§ade product that fits in between traditional
concrete paneling and curtain wall, glass curtain wall. And it hits a price point. And there isn't anything similar
in the Australian market. So -- but we'll lose money in that. That's a part of the $10 million investment we
called out. We'll lose money in that business in the first year, single digit millions, but we see that as an
opportunity for growth over the longer term.

SOPHIE SPARTALIS: So what do you see as the trigger then? You talked about given that people are so
busy at the moment, they're not willing to switch. What do you see as the trigger for an acceleration in the
pickup of these prefab offerings?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: In the first one, it's labor constraint and just upsetting customers because you
promised their house is going to be finished on a certain date and it's 6 months later. We all know the
consequences of that. And the second one is actually a price point in commercial, because commercial

Page9of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.construction with the industrial relations environment is very expensive to build on-site in Australia. So that -- I
think that will accelerate as it has done in the U.K. and Europe where offsite constructions has been a much
higher proportion of the build. It's faster to build and you don't need the people on-site. And these things -- it's
a bit like a start-up, Sophie. I think is the best -- and that's why we've used this lean start-up mentality.
Starting these businesses from scratch, it's actually highly engaging internally as well as for your customers,
but the runway is 4 to 5 years often.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from David Rosenbloom from ARCO Investment Management.

DAVID ROSENBLOOM: Rob, just a couple of questions. I'm just trying to reconcile a couple of comments
that you made like that there wasn't much margin difference between the detached and multi-dwelling. And I
guess, your expectations seem to be that detached was going to stay at these elevated levels, but multi
coming off. So I'm not quite sure how that reconciles to more of the same kind of thing.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I was talking about product margins. So a tonne of plasterboards sold into a
residential and a tonne of plasterboard sold into commercial, the same margin, relatively the same margin. At
the gross level, the margin coming out of commercial -- out of multifamily will reduce, but not at the product
level. Does that make sense?

DAVID ROSENBLOOM: But it's a dollar level, obviously, those with volumes coming off, but it just seems a
bit confusing. But okay.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: I talk about EBIT margin per tonne of revenue -- per dollar of revenue is similar.
You'll lose more revenue out of commercial than you will out of detached.

DAVID ROSENBLOOM: Okay and the second question I have was just looking at the increase in revenue in
the Building Products business and the margin. And even when you add back the $9 million from energy.
Would -- I guess I would have expected more incremental margin, especially if we were taking price as well
across the board. Can you talk through that or am I off the mark there?

DAVID FALLU: I guess part of the aspect I'd comment to there is the fact that within our component of that
volume growth, you're seeing, for instance in Hebel, imported product to cover the capacity that we can't
manufacture. That obviously comes in at a higher cost to our manufactured costs. And therefore, the margin
associated with that product is less.

DAVID ROSENBLOOM: So the Hebel margin is under a bit of pressure and that's been a growing volume.

DAVID FALLU: Yes, because they're growing volume and supplementing their manufactured capacity with
higher cost imported product, which will be replaced by the new facility in -- that we're creating.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Tim Piper from Bell Potter Securities.

TIM PIPER, ANALYST, BELL POTTER SECURITIES LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I guess I'll cycle
back to something I think was related to one of the previous questions. The growth investment in the Building
Products in that waterfall chart of negative $3 million, is that Ingleburn what you're referring to before included
in that?

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: No. Do you want to answer that?

DAVID FALLU: Sorry, no, that's not -- that incremental investment is in relation to the offsite construction
system that Rob was referring to in the commercial space, the in-close faÃ§ade system.

TIM PIPER: Right. So that negative $3 million growth investment. I think that was negative $12 million last
year?

DAVID FALLU: Yes.

TIM PIPER: So what's the run -- some of those products, what's the run rate in earnings looking like over the
next couple of years for that?

DAVID FALLU: So they -- those investments and -- that total investment of $15 million covers everything from
our digital platform, the new start-up businesses, like the incremental revenue that will be coming from that is
effectively in a start-up phase, so we're not expecting an EBIT return on that this year or next. What we're
saying is developing those businesses to position them for -- as they develop. So that will be velocity in-close
and then to the extent at which we're transitioning customers into a more digital relationship with us.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: And I'd probably put another comment to that. On Slide 22, we talked about our
Building Products revenue relative to work done. And I think some of that incremental investment is what gets
you that out performance. So it's doing stuff differently relative to your competitors, which means you'll either

Page10of11©2018Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.grow it through market share or some incremental product category, and that's basically what that -- is driving
that out performance on Slide 22.

TIM PIPER: Okay and just going back to CapEx again. It looks like total year CapEx was a bit below where
you're guiding to. It looks like possibly growth CapEx in the Building Products was a bit less. Is that right?

DAVID FALLU: Yes, it's predominantly timing associated with the Hebel expansion with some of the delay
moving into YEM19.

TIM PIPER: Yes, okay. And then just on the Property CapEx. Just given your comments around negative net
cash flow next year, that -- is that indicating probably CapEx is going to be rising again next year?

DAVID FALLU: Probably CapEx will be at a higher level. And also, the sales that we've announced, the cash
flow for those sales will be recorded in YEM20. So the ROCE on sales in December '19, and Horsley Park
also '19.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Lee Power from Deutsche Bank.

LEE POWER, ASSOCIATE ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just following on
from the Property comments. Given the elevated Property CapEx. I mean, outflows in '19, do you think the
cash flows that have been delayed and coming into '20, are they gonna offset that increase and we should
return to net inflows in '20, or do we have to wait to '21 when Schofield comes online?

DAVID FALLU: That will more than offset in YEM20. So there's in excess of $100 million from Horsley and
Rosehill in YEM20.

OPERATOR: There are no further questions from the phones.

ALAN ROBERT SINDEL: Great. Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your support, as I said, and we'll leave
it there. And I'm sure we'll have many questions over the next couple of days and look forward to speaking to
you in person. Thanks very much. Bye-bye.
