SALES

Caulfield North

Competitive bidding pushed the sale of a three-level office at 73 Kooyong Road to a record land rate. Leased
to medical practice the Precision Brain, Spine and Pain Centre, the property sold for $4,825,000. The
previous highest land rate in the area was $5900 per sq m. The sale set a new rate of $9600. CBRE's Bianca
Butterworth, Sandro Peluso, Josh Twelftree and Kinson Wong said the vendor, neurosurgeon and researcher
Richard Bittar, gained a 20 per cent lift after buying it 15 months ago.

Berwick

A strata-titled shop leased to Fit Burger has served up a strong auction result. Fitzroys' James Lockwood said
the five-year lease generated significant interest for Shop 3 at 240-246 Clyde Road, which sold for $745,000.
It returned $42,000 per annum plus GST in rent. Another local investor paid more than $10,100 per sq m for a
boutique shop opposite the Cato Square development in Prahran. Mr Lockwood sold Shop 2 at 119 Izett
Street for $505,000.

Braeside

Raphael Favas and Daniel Wolman from Colliers International negotiated the sale of a petrol station leased to
Caltex Woolworths. The property, on the corner of Boundary and Malcolm roads, was contested by local and
interstate investors before selling for $4.15 million.

Clayton South

A warehouse/showroom at 1/80 Fairbank Road has sold for $4 million on a 6 per cent yield. The property was
leased to Trico Products for annual rent of $240,000. Mark Spigelman from Lawson Real Estate said the
market "keeps getting stronger with the lack of quality properties being offered".

Cheltenham

Nearly three-quarters of Cheltenham's Modus Business Estate has sold for prices ranging from $430,000 to
$938,500, CVA's John Nockles and Seamus Bolst said. The pair also sold half of Moorabbin's newest
boutique estate at 35 Levanswell Road. "Local councils report more than 90 per cent of new businesses in
the area have three employees or less, so it's not surprising smaller strata buildings are in demand," Mr
Nockles said.

Kew

At least three townhouses will be built at 116 Walpole Street after a local developer purchased the site for
$3.3 million, Savills Australia's Jesse Radisich, Nick Peden and Benson Zhou said. "Blue-chip suburbs such
as Kew are very resilient and there is always a high level of demand," Mr Radisich said. Another site at 291
Grange Road and 4 Walsh Street in Ormond sold for $3.38 million to a Chinese developer, Mr Radisich, Mr
Peden and Julian Heatherich said. In Camberwell, 1308-1310 Toorak Road sold for $3.96 million. Mr Peden
and Mr Radisich brokered the deal with Woodards Blackburn's Sam Ejtemai and Julian Badenach.
