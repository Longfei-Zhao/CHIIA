FOOD BABY food supplier Bubs Australia is charging ahead after the buyout of goat-milk products maker
NuLac Foods helped deliver a fivefold increase in quarterly sales.

Bubs says third-quarter net sales grew 422 per cent to $5.2 million compared with the same period a year
ago. Sales to China rose 55 per cent.

The lift came from both the Bubs business and NuLac Foods, which completed its first full quarter of trading
under Bubs’ ownership.

Sales of goat-milk infant formula were up by 63 per cent. Bubs bought NuLac for $39 million in November.

“We continue to make solid progress on our strategic journey to increase domestic penetration of our product
range, and expand channel capability into China,” Bubs chief Nicholas Simms said yesterday.

“Our penetration into China’s cross-border e-commerce channel continues to develop, most notably with our
entering an international supply agreement with Chinese online giant JD.com,” Mr Simms said.

Bubs said all three stages of its goat-milk infant formula would be sold in Woolworths supermarkets from this
month, and some varieties of organic baby cereals would start to appear at the supermarket chain next
month.Shares in Sydney-based Bubs closed yesterday 7c, or 9.2 per cent, higher at 83c.
