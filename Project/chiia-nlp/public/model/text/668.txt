ExxonMobil	resumes	quake-hit	PNG	LNG	production
ahead	of	schedule

February,	its	Australian	partners	said	on	Friday.

MELBOURNE	(April	13):	ExxonMobil	Corp	has	resumed	production	at	the
Papua	New	Guinea	liquefied	natural	gas	(LNG)	project	a	fortnight	ahead	of
schedule	after	it	was	shut	down	in	the	wake	of	a	deadly	earthquake	in

Production	at	the	PNG	LNG	project	was	halted	after	a	7.5	magnitude	earthquake	hit	Papua	New
Guinea's	energy-rich	interior	on	Feb.	26,	causing	landslides,	damaging	buildings	and	killing	100	people.

Australia's	Oil	Search	Ltd	and	Santos	Ltd	said	they	had	been	advised	that	one	train	at	the	LNG	plant
near	Port	Moresby	has	re-started	operations	and	the	second	train	is	expected	to	resume	as	gas
production	ramps	up.

LNG	exports,	which	were	expected	to	resume	shortly,	will	come	weeks	ahead	of	schedule	and	may	put
pressure	on	spot	LNG	prices,	traders	said.	Exxon	Mobil	Corp	had	earlier	advised	that	production	would
restart	in	May	2018.

"The	recommencement	of	operations	at	the	PNG	LNG	Project,	ahead	of	ExxonMobil's	previously	guided
eight	week	timeframe,	is	a	major	achievement	by	the	operator,"	said	Oil	Search	Managing	Director	Peter
Botten.

Exxon	Mobil	was	able	to	restart	production	earlier	than	expected	because	damage	to	hundreds	of
kilometres	of	pipelines	that	run	through	the	mountains	between	gas	output	facilities	and	the	LNG
terminal	was	much	less	than	initially	feared,	a	source	involved	with	the	project	told	Reuters.

Santos	is	a	foundation	partner	and	holds	a	13.5%	interest	in	PNG	LNG.	Oil	Search	has	a	29%	stake.

Exxon	Mobil	declared	force	majeure	on	exports	from	PNG	in	March	and	the	resulting	uncertainty	over
supply	drained	liquidity	from	Asia's	spot	LNG	markets,	traders	said.

"At	the	time	the	project	was	halted	in	late	February,	it	was	a	time	in	the	year	when	LNG	prices	were	to
gradually	fall	down	as	demand	eases,"	said	one	industry	source	in	Tokyo.

"The	halt	did	have	some	impact	in	that	it	took	longer	for	(Asian	benchmark)	prices	to	fall,	but	the	impact
was	rather	limited	because	demand	was	weak	at	the	time,"	he	said.

Asian	spot	LNG	prices	have	lost	almost	70%	from	their	2014	peak	to	around	US$7	per	million	British
thermal	units	(mmBtu),	driven	lower	by	a	global	supply	overhang	that	developed	as	new	production
came	online,	especially	in	Australia	and	the	United	States.

Worry	about	the	surplus	has	been	tempered	somewhat	by	unexpectedly	strong	demand	out	of	China,
India	and	Southeast	Asia,	especially	over	this	past	winter.

Before	the	quake,	the	PNG	LNG	project	had	been	producing	at	around	20%	above	its	rated	capacity	of
6.9	million	tonnes	a	year.

Another	trader	said	that	although	the	announcement	would	likely	weigh	on	prices,	any	fall	"will	be

limited	by	summer	demand	expected	soon	from	Asia."
