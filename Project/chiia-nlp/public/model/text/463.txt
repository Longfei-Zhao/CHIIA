Following its expansion in Australia with Perth and Sydney last month, cab-hailing company Ola has
launched its service in Melbourne. The company said that, it will further continue its rollout in Australia, with
future launch cities including Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Canberra, Adelaide, Darwin and Hobart.

The company has received 15,000 registrations from driver partners across Australia till date. Ola is also
offering introductory commission rate 7.5% and daily payments in the state. It is unclear, what is the
commission rate otherwise in the country.

Remember how it started in India? Cab aggregators including Ola started with low commission price then
increased it as they grew operations. This led to a situation where that drivers were are not able to make their
ends meet or pay EMIs for their car loans. In February 2017, we saw the first instance where an Ola driver
tried to kill himself by consuming poison in a strike in Bangalore. Ola and Uber encourage drivers to buy cars
on loan. Many drivers bought cars as they were lured by higher incomes the companies offered in 2015 and
2016 when the companies were starting their operations. Drivers MediaNama spoke to said that in 2016 and
2015, they had monthly earnings of Rs 85,000 and Rs 70,000. Now their earnings have fallen to around Rs
51,000.

Ola said that it is also developing a number of new initiatives for its customers and driver-partners, which
include updates to the Ola app and building its local support team that will help build a better ride share
experience.

Ola’s Expansion

Ola has been looking at expansion in other counties such as New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and
has teams in Dhaka and Colombo. This comes after it raised $1.1 billion in October last year, led by Tencent
Holdings Limited and existing investor SoftBank. SoftBank is also a investor in its rival Uber which picked up
15% stake in the company for an investment of $1.25 billion along with other investors. However, its teams in
Sri Lanka are in a spot of trouble, though: the company has already been accusedof “commercial espionage”
by competitor PickMe.

Global competition

Uber is already present in Australia and other international countries. In Australia, Uber nearly has 82,000
active drivers. Europe-based Taxify also set up shop there (Australia) recently. Taxify operates in 20 cities
across Australia and New Zealand. Chinese online taxi company Didi picked up a minority stake in Taxify for
an undisclosed amount. Didi also has a stake in Ola, and bought Uber’s China business for a reported $1
billion in August 2016.
