AGL Energy says it is assessing an offer from Hong Kong-owned rival Alinta Energy for an ageing power
station in the Hunter Valley.

Alinta has offered $250 million for AGL’s Liddell power station. AGL confirmed yesterday it had received a
non-binding, “highly conditional” cash offer from Alinta and its owner, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, for the
plant and site.

The company said it was assessing the proposal but couldn’t give an assurance that a deal would result.

Alinta previously indicated it could spend about $1 billion on Liddell, including the purchase price and capital
investment.

Its offer is set to ramp up pressure on AGL to either sell or reverse its controversial decision to shut down the
coal-fired power station by 2022.

Alinta said the offer represented “a compelling commercial proposition for AGL shareholders”.AGL previously
said it had not sought to sell Liddell as it needed the plant to provide energy until 2022, and for repurposing
as part of a new-generation plan after that date.
