•Nielsen	reports	seafood	sales	increased	3.4%	year	over	year	through	Feb.	24.	Much	of
that	uptick,	though,	is	likely	due	to	the	4.5%	increase	in	average	retail	price	—	volume

Nielsen	notes	volume	sales	of	scallops	grew	15%	year	over	year	and	flounder	sales	grew

•Nearly	one	in	five	of	U.S.	shoppers	say	they’d	like	to	eat	more	fish,	but	consumers	are
concerned	about	seafood	quality	and	freshness.	Some	don’t	know	how	to	cook	or	prepare
fish,	while	others	have	concerns	about	whether	the	seafood	is	responsibly	sourced.

Fisheries	and	Oceans	Canada	is	looking	into	whether	a	fish	farm	company	has	been
