Broo chief executive Kent Grogan alongside the site at the Delacombe Town Centre, which was due to be a burger bar operated by the company.

Broo had intended to unveil a beer and burger bar at Ballarat’s newest shopping centre by November 2017 in addition to developing a $100 million brewing facility
in the city’s premier industrial estate. 

Leedwell Property real estate agent Nick Segran confirmed the 330-square-metre standalone premises was back on the market for lease.

In a statement a company spokesperson said “Broo concluded recently that its operations focusing in the Ballarat precinct are better served by expansion of the
proposed development at BWEZ”. 

The brewer was among the first companies announced as a presence within BWEZ when it unveiled its plans for a 15-hectare site in February 2017.

Artist impressions of Broo's planned $100 million BWEZ brewery

On top of developing “:the world’s greenest brewery”, the company also outlined plans to create a 10,000-capacity events space, a beer museum, an energy
education centre, a restaurant and bars.   

The architectural designs also showed a  45-metre viewing platform equipped with a zipline back down to ground.  The company has predicted the facility would
generate about 100 ongoing jobs.

“An additional parcel of land adjacent to the Broo site within BWEZ is currently being discussed with the State Government to accommodate the extra facets of
the project as part of this staged development project,” the statement read.   

The expansion discussions come just months after the company landed a giant $120 million beer distribution deal in China which will see 1.5 billion litres of lager
purchased over seven years.

Broo's 15-hectare block in the Ballarat West Employment Zone.

The company, which has its headquarters based in Sorrento, paid about $2.16 million for the 15-hectare block. 

The brewer initially intended to begin works at BWEZ by February 2018, with construction expected to take two years.  All up the facility is expected to be able to
produce 480 million bottles of beer a year.
