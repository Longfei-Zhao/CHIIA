About Starpharma

Starpharma Holdings Limited (ASX: SPL, OTCQX:SPHRY), located in Melbourne Australia, is an ASX 300
company and is a world leader in the development of dendrimer products for pharmaceutical, life science and
other applications.

Starpharma's underlying technology is built around dendrimers -- a type of synthetic nanoscale polymer that
is highly regular in size and structure and well suited to pharmaceutical and medical uses. Starpharma has
two core development programs: VivaGel(R) portfolio and DEP(R) drug delivery with the Company
developing a number of products internally and others via commercial partnerships.

VivaGel(R) : Starpharma's portfolio includes women's health products based on VivaGel(R) (SPL7013,
astodrimer sodium), a proprietary dendrimer. VivaGel(R) BV is approved for marketing in the EU and
Australia for bacterial vaginosis (BV). Starpharma has a license agreement with Aspen Pharmacare Australia
Pty Ltd for the sales and marketing of VivaGel(R) BV in Australia and New Zealand. Starpharma has also
developed an antiviral condom which uses VivaGel(R) in the lubricant, which is available in Australia and
Canada under the Lifestyles(R) Dual Protect(TM) brand. Starpharma has a number of license agreements to
market the VivaGel(R) condom in other regions, including China and Japan (Okamoto).

DEP(R) - Dendrimer Enhanced Product(R) : Starpharma's DEP(R) drug delivery platform has demonstrated
reproducible preclinical benefits across multiple internal and partnered DEP(R) programs, including improved
efficacy, safety and survival. Starpharma has two internal DEP(R) products -- DEP(R) docetaxel and DEP(R)
cabazitaxel - in clinical development in patients with solid tumours, and further DEP(R) products approaching
clinical development. Starpharma's partnered DEP(R) programs include a multiproduct DEP(R) licence with
AstraZeneca, which involves the development and commercialisation of two novel oncology compounds, with
potential to add more.
