Richmond vanadium project JV (AXF Resources) (see Note 3 below)

Intermin owns 100% in five Mineral Exploration Permits (EPM25163, EPM25164, EPM25258, EPM26425 and
EPM26426) covering 481 Blocks near Richmond and 100% of the metal rights to Global Oil Shale Plc's Julia
Creek (Burwood) MDL 522 (see Figure 3 in link below). The current Mineral Resource for Richmond is
2,579Mt grading 0.32% V2O5 at a 0.29% cut-off grade (see Note 3 below).

As announced to the ASX on 19 September 2017, Intermin completed a formal Joint Venture agreement with
AXF over the Richmond project. AXF brings considerable technical expertise to the project and has extensive
business relationships throughout Southeast Asia.

Details of the agreement between the parties include:

- An earn-in Joint Venture whereby AXF can earn 25% of the project area by spending A$1m within a one
year period and maintaining the project in good standing

- AXF to solely contribute to further expenditure of A$5m on the projects to earn a further 50% over a three
year period, inclusive of the completion of a Feasibility Study on part or all of the project area

- During the sole funding period, AXF will manage the exploration program and tenure with direction from the
JV committee comprising representatives from both parties

- Upon AXF satisfying the earn-in terms, each party will contribute to ongoing expenditure in accordance with
its respective percentages

AXF has now formally committed to the stage 2 expenditure commitment of A$5m over three years to March
2021 inclusive of a Feasibility Study on commercial production. Metallurgical testwork is underway at two
leading Chinese research institutes to assess optimal pre-concentration steps and downstream processing
options. Initial results on pre-concentration of the ore are expected in the current June Quarter. Infill drilling of
the high grade Lilyvale prospect is planned for the September Quarter 2018 with the aim of upgrading the
Resource to the Measured and Indicated Categories. Initial discussions will also commence with potential
offtake partners and local, state and national stakeholders.

Binduli project JV (Evolution Mining) (see Note 4 below)

In April 2015, Intermin and its 100% owned subsidiary Black Mountain Gold Limited ("BMG") entered into a
farm-in and JV agreement with La Mancha Australia Pty Ltd which was subsequently acquired by Evolution
Mining Limited (ASX:EVN) ("Evolution") (refer Evolution ASX announcement dated 20 April 2015). Under the
terms of the agreement, Evolution had the right to earn up to 70% of the Binduli Gold Project near Kalgoorlie
in Western Australia by spending $4.6m over five years.

Evolution has completed a 3,597m aircore program to the south of the Teal project area and a 4,006m
reverse circulation program in the Coot, Crake and Honey Eater prospect areas. The results from the
December program have not yet been announced by Evolution, however they were only recently presented to
Intermin in late March. Some minor mineralisation was discovered with several drill holes recording low tenor,
but anomalous mineralisation.

On 14 March 2018, Evolution provided notice of its intention to withdraw from the joint venture. As such, the
project area now reverts back to Intermin on a 100% basis. Intermin will now review all the latest information
and commence drilling in the current June Quarter 2018 with an initial 5,000m program planned at Coot,
Crake, Darter and Honey Eater (see Figure 4 in link below).

Menzies - Goongarrie JV (Eastern Goldfields) (see Note 5 below)

Intermin executed a binding Heads of Agreement ("HoA") with Eastern Goldfields Limited (ASX:EGS) ("EGS")
to form a JV covering Intermin's projects in the Menzies and Goongarrie region (see Figure 5 in link below)
which was formalised in June 2017.

Details of the Agreement between the parties include:

- An earn in JV whereby EGS can earn 25% of the project areas by spending A$2m within a two year period
and a further 25% by spending A$2m over the following two year period

- EGS to solely contribute to further expenditure of $1.5m on the projects inclusive of a Bankable Feasibility
Study to support a mill installation in the Mt Ida / Menzies region to earn a further 15%

JV committee comprising representatives from both parties

- Upon EGS satisfying the earn in terms, each party will contribute to ongoing expenditure in accordance with
their respective percentages

Exploration drilling has now commenced in the Menzies region with EGS mobilising a multi-purpose rig for
diamond tail drilling at the Lady Irene prospect and the historic Yunndaga mine. Drilling results from both
programs are expected in the September Quarter 2018.

Nanadie Well JV (Mithril Resources) (see Note 4 below)

In December 2013, Intermin entered into a farm-in and joint venture agreement with Mithril Resources
(ASX:MTH) covering the Intermin's projects in the Murchison mineral field south east of Meekatharra (see
Figure 6 in link below).

A number of revisions to the Agreement have been approved by both parties and include:

- An earn in JV whereby Mithril can earn 60% by spending A$2m by December 2019 and maintaining the
project in good standing

- Mithril to solely contribute to further expenditure of $2m on the projects to earn a further 15% over a two
year period

- During the sole funding period, Mithril will manage the exploration program and tenure

- Upon Mithril satisfying the earn in terms, each party will contribute to ongoing expenditure in accordance
with their respective percentages

Given the prospectivity for multiple commodities in the region, Mithril is now focussed on further exploration
work at the Nanadie Well Copper Deposit and the adjacent Stark Copper Nickel Prospect. Mithril is currently
reviewing both localities with a view to potentially carrying out further drilling in June or September 2018
Quarters.

Lehmans JV (Saracen Mineral Holdings) (see Note 4 below)

The Lehmans Gold JV covers over 20km of strike of the Yandal greenstone belt immediately adjacent to the
Thunderbox Gold Mine owned by Saracen Mineral Holdings Limited (ASX:SAR) ("Saracen"). The project is
located approximately 45km south of Leinster in Western Australia and the tenements currently consist of 14
Mining Leases and two Prospecting Licences (see Figure 1 in link below).

Intermin retains a 10% interest and is free carried to a decision to mine.

Saracen has recently completed a small pre-feasibility drill program on the Lehmans Gold JV and is planning
further exploration drilling in the project area in the June and September Quarters 2018.

Janet Ivy gold royalty (Norton Gold Fields) (see Note 6 below)

Intermin owns a $0.50/t mining royalty that relates to ore mined and treated from Mining Lease M26/446
located approximately 10km west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder in Western Australia (see Figure 1 in link below). The
Company entered into a Deed for the sale of M26/446 in 2001 and it is now owned by Norton Gold Fields Ltd
("NGF") which was delisted from the ASX on 1 July 2015.

As part of the sale, Intermin was prepaid $1,380,000 of the royalty as part of the acquisition cost, equivalent
to a mining and treatment tonnage of 2.76Mt. Mining has been conducted on a semi-continuous basis at the
Janet Ivy deposit which is the largest of known deposits on M26/466 since 2009.

Mill factored reconciliation at the end of December 2017 was 2,904,394t treated at the Paddington mill of
which 144,394t was subject to mining royalty payments of A$72,000 which have been received.

Ore treated from the tenement at the Paddington mill in the March Quarter was 425,000t and is subject to
royalty payments of $212,500. Intermin anticipates further royalty payments on a quarterly basis for material
scheduled by NGF to be treated.
