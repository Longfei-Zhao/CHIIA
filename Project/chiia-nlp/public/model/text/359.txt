There is a new player in town looking to purchase as many rock lobsters and king crabs from KI commercial
fishers as possible.

Mt Gambier-based seafood exporter Best Ociana Seafood has set up shop in an existing but unused seafood
processing and lobster holding facility in Kingscote.

Chief executive officer John Brady said his company was looking to expand its exports into Asia and wanted
to access northern zone rock lobster to take advantage that zone's longer harvest period.

"Our ambition is to be a year-round supplier to our customers in Asia of live southern rock lobster, as well as
king crab," Mr Brady said.

Best Ociana Seafood is a southern rock lobster quota holder in the Southern Zone fishery and has
established long-term commercial relationships with fishers in that area, he said.

It now wanted to build relationships with rock lobster fishers on KI and also other Northern Zone quota
holders that can drop off their catch at either Vivonne Bay or Kingscote.

"We'll work to have successful win-win partnerships with fishers on Kangaroo Island and as far away as Port
Lincoln and Pondalowie," Mr Brady said.

It has an employee in Kingscote and is refurbishing its facility.

"We are family business and want to build long-term relationships with local fishers, providing the right service
and making it convenient as possible," Mr Brady said.

Best Ociana Seafood acquired Fitzgerald Fish Sales in Mount Gambier in 2016, and now takes in lobsters at
seven ports from Cape Jaffa to Port McDonnell. It exported more than 400 metric-tonnes of live lobster last
year, primarily to China, Hong Kong and Singapore.
