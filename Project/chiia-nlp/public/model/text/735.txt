As	global	consumer	habits	shift	towards	healthier	eating	Freedom	Foods	is	making	a	feast	of	the	opportunities

Already	a	big	producer	of	plant-based	beverages	such	as	almond	"milk",	Freedom	Foods	Group	pushes	its	growth	agenda	further	next	month	when	it	launches	long	life
dairy	products	to	the	domestic	market	under	its	Australia’s	Own	label.

Cereals,	snacks	and	beverage	maker	Freedom	Foods	is	proving	to	be	a	new	era	growth	story	for	Australia’s	food	sector	–	an	industry	where	the	past	20	years’	headlines
have	often	been	about	factory	closures	and	foreign	takeovers.

The	33-year-old	UHT	products	packer,	turned	health	food	brand	leader	has	built	a	“disrupter”	reputation	in	the	grocery	segment	with	a	product	suite	spanning	allergen-
free	snack	bars	and	breakfast	cereals;	almond,	rice	and	soy	“milks”,	and	lately,	sports	supplements.

Also,	our	biggest	processor	and	exporter	of	ultra-high	temperature	(UHT)	treated	beverages,	Freedom	hits	domestic	milk	markets	next	month	with	its	own	A2	and
reduced	fat	range	under	the	Australia’s	Own	label.

It	also	plans	a	move	into	yoghurt.

Freedom’s	dairy	connections	extend	to	its	cornerstone	shareholder,	Leppington	Pastoral	Company’s	Perich	family,	which	has	supplied	milk	to	the	processor	for	almost	20
years	and	owns	about	54	per	cent	of	the	business.
Growing	at	pace
In	the	past	decade	Freedom	has	built	cereal	processing	plants	at	Leeton	and	Darlington	Point	in	South	West	NSW	and	bought	another	at	Dandenong	in	Victoria.

“Freedom	Foods	is	in	a	prime	position	to	disrupt	larger	FMGC	competitors	weighed	down	by	less	healthy	legacy	products”	-	Citigroup	Research

It	has	also	recently	built	efficient	new	beverage	factories	in	Sydney	and	Shepparton,	Victoria.

Since	2013	Freedom	Foods	Group’s	share	price	has	risen	from	below	$1	to	this	week	breaking	$6.

Investment	bank,	Citigroup,	says	the	company’s	expanding	focus	on	higher	margin	branded	products	and	export	growth	is	worth	a	target	price	closer	to	$6.70/share.

As	global	consumer	habits	shift	towards	healthier	eating,	a	Citi	research	study	noted	Freedom’s	attention	to	healthy	food	and	beverages	put	it	“in	a	prime	position	to
disrupt	larger	fast	moving	consumer	goods	competitors	which	are	arguably	weighed	down	by	less	healthy	legacy	products”.

“We	expect	Freedom	to	achieve	shelf	space	gains	from	about	40	new	branded	products	launched	from	May,”	the	report	said.

Much	of	its	growth	to	date	was	built	on	contract	packing	UHT	(long	life)	milk	and	plant-based	beverages	for	other	brands,	including	an	extensive	Chinese	export
program.

Freedom	Foods	is	challenging	Devondale's	strength	in	the	long	life	dairy	products	category	in	Australia.
Challenging	tradition
Its	new	domestic-focused	UHT	product	push	looks	to	target	the	troubled	Devondale	(Murray	Goulburn)	business,	a	leading	Australian	long	life	milk	brand	for	decades.

Soon	to	be	acquired	by	Canada’s	Saputo	Inc	for	$1.3	billion,	Murray	Goulburn	has	a	depleted	milk	pool	to	stretch	across	a	busy	product		range	from	cheese	to	high	value
nutritional	formulas.

UHT	production	is	likely	to	be	restricted	until	MG’s	milk	receivals	improve.

“We’ve	had	a	lot	of	demand	come	our	way	in	the	UHT	market,”	conceded	Freedom	managing	director	Rory	Macleod.

“Priorities	have	changed	for	many	in	the	dairy	sector.

“Ultimately	we	will	see	more	competition	from	Devondale,	but	I	don’t	see	Saputo	breathing	new	life	into	the	UHT	market	for	a	while.”

Freedom	Foods	raising	$200m

Thirsty	Freedom	signs	new	suppliers

Freedom	Foods	tips	its	total	sales	will	lift	at	least	40pc	this	financial	year	to	about	$380	million	and	potentially	towards	$600m	in	2018-19.

Its	brands	include	Australia's	Own,	So	Natural,	Blue	Diamond,	Arnold’s	Farm	and	the	Freedom	cereal	and	snack	labels.

“We’ve	used	private	label	work	to	build	our	business	capacity”	-	Rory	Macleod,	Freedom	Foods

Bolstered	by	a	$200m	shareholder	capital	raising	finalised	last	week,	the	company	wants	to	accelerate	its	production	and	acquisition	activities,	including	increasing	UHT
capacity	at	its	Shepparton	plant	in	Victoria	to	500m	litres	a	year	and	commence	bottled	and	functional	milk	and	drinking	yoghurt	lines	at	its	new	Sydney	site.

“We’ve	used	private	label	work	to	build	our	business	capacity	–	now	we’re	building	on	that	with	our	own	branded	lines,”	Mr	Macleod	said.

The	UHT	future
While	UHT	has	not	previously	enjoyed	the	premium	market	status	of	fresh	dairy,	Mr	Macleod	noted	it	was	the	popular	packing	choice	for	milk	globally,	saving	retailers
and	distributors	shelf	space	and	refrigeration	costs.

Freedom	Foods	managing	director,	Rory	Macleod.

“The	taste	issues	of	the	past	are	no	longer,	and	in	general	I	think	we’ll	see	a	lot	more	of	UHT	as	a	mainstream	product	of	the	future,”	he	said.

The	Australia’s	Own	brand	is	at	the	forefront	of	Freedom’s	UHT	product	innovation	and	marketing	push	in	Australia	and	overseas.

It	already	has	a	footprint	in	China,	South	East	Asia,	while	Freedom’s	health-focused	cereals	and	snacks	are	sales	leaders	on	e-commerce	site	Tmall	and	have	sold	well
in	North	America	since	2015.

In	a	sector	littered	with	remnants	of	former	big	name	brands	and	factories	unable	to	compete	in	today’s	globalised	economy,	Freedom’s	business	tactics	have	proven
refreshingly	successful.

“There	wasn’t	much	pro-investment	psychology	in	the	Australian	food	industry.”	-	Rory	Macleod,	Freedom	Foods

“Today’s	export	market	dynamics	have	certainly	helped	our	case,	but	Australian	food	processors	tended	to	suffer	from	insufficient	investment	for	a	long	time,”	Mr
Macleod	said.

“There	wasn’t	much	pro-investment	psychology	in	the	Australian	food	industry.

“The	1980s	and	’90s	saw	a	lot	of	cost	saving	consolidation	as	big	groups	moved	in,	acquiring	more	scale	and	market	share.

“But	plants	were	still	expensive	to	run	…	and	supermarkets	grew	more	demanding	on	price	and	product	innovation.

Part	of	Freedom	Foods'	diverse	breakfast	cereal	portfolio.

“Now,	however,	there’s	a	whole	new	global	market	demanding	Australian	food	–	we	don’t	need	to	sell	to	Coles	and	Woolies.
New	market	focus
“And	why	send	agricultural	commodities	overseas	when	we	can	add	value	to	Australia’s	unique	grain	and	dairy	supply	base	here,	and	reap	the	reward	here.”

Consumers	had	changed,	too,	hungry	for	the	specialty	attributes	in	Freedom’s	“free	from”	foods.

“So	many	healthy	eating	preferences	and	population	growth	dynamics	are	at	play	–	the	opportunities	are	very	exciting,”	he	said.

“But	to	be	part	of	that	growing	world	market,	you	must	invest	and	develop	an	efficient	conversion	base.

“You	also	need	supportive	stakeholders	behind	you.”

“As	a	family	we’ve	always	believed	in	the	food	and	dairy	industry’s	strengths	and	saw	potential	in	what	Freedom	was	doing”	-	Michael	Perich,	Leppington	pastoral
Company

While	Australia’s	food	and	agribusiness	sector	had	attracted	more	investor	attention	of	late,	Freedom	was	“extremely	fortunate”	to	have	had	support	from	long-term	key
investors	who	were	also	farmers.

“The	Perich	family’s	interest	has	been	pivotal	in	stabilising	our	business	and	guiding	us	in	our	partnerships	with	farmer	suppliers,”	he	said.

Freedom	Foods	Group's	four-year-old	Shepparton	dairy	processing	plant	receives	milk	from	farm	in	surrounding	in	northern	Victoria	and	southern	NSW.

The	rewards	cut	both	ways	according	to	family	member,	dairy	farmer	and	Freedom	director,	Michael	Perich.

“Our	connection	began	as	milk	suppliers,	but	as	a	family	we’ve	always	believed	in	the	food	and	dairy	industry’s	strengths	and	saw	potential	in	what	Freedom	was	doing,”
he	said.

“As	we	got	to	understand	the	business	we	grew	more	involved	in	backing	its	progress.

“That	includes	offering	a	grassroots	view	on	how	farmers	think	and	what	they	expect	from	a	relationship	with	buyers.”

Now	majority	shareholders,	the	Perich’s	supply	a	portion	of	the	processor’s	milk	needs	from	their	8000-cow	dairy	ventures	also	own	Freedom’s	$75m	Ingleburn	factory
and	its	Sydney	headquarters	at	Taren	Point.
