April 10 (SeeNews) – Chinese clean energy firm ENN Ecological Holdings Co Ltd (SHA:600803), a large
shareholder in Santos Ltd (ASX:STO), has said it would carefully examine US-based Harbour Energy‘s bid
for the Australian oil and gas producer, stressing that itintends to remain involved with the target company.

Santos is an important part of ENN’s long-term strategy for clean energy and the Chinese investor is
optimistic about the future development of the Australia company, according to a filing with the Shanghaistock
exchange submitted by ENN earlier in April.

That is why ENN intends to keep a long-term strategic cooperation with Santos. For that purpose, the
Chinese group will engage with and enter into negotiations and other specific consultations with the US
suitor,the filing said further.

Santos at the beginning of April agreed to review an improved unsolicited takeover bid from Harbour Energy
that values it at AUD 6.50 (USD 5.02/EUR 4.07) per share and also granted the suitor access to due
diligence. The offer was submitted on March 29 and was Harbour Energy’s fourth approach to the Australian
firm.

Under the proposed terms, current shareholders of Santos can retain a combined stake of 15% to 20% in the
Australian company.

Santos saw its shares close without a significant change at AUD5.94 on Tuesday. The company’s market
value stands at AUD 12.29 billion, according to data of theAustralian Securities Exchange (ASX).

(AUD 1.0 = USD 0.772/EUR 0.627)
