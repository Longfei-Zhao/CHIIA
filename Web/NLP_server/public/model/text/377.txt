DISABILITY support service Windarring is “in the market” to buy the historic Kyneton Primary School site.

Windarring chairman Chinka Steel told the Leader it wanted to buy the site from the State Government. Last
Wednesday, the organisation presented to Ethos Urban as part of a consultation process on three
management and use proposals put forward.

However, the Kyneton Town Square Reference Group says a community-run model remained the best
management future for the site.

Its spokesman Huntly Barton said Windarring should only be a tenant at a future hub.

“Windarring was created for the people of Kyneton 20 to 30 years ago and their work is highly respected,” he
said.

“We’d acknowledge Mr Steel and his board in good faith, but if the property went to their ownership, what’s to
say another board and administration might want to sell the land off in the future?

“We’d have no protection under such a scenario.” Mr Barton, who is critical of the three proposals put forward
under future use models, said Windarring would be an ideal tenant for a broader community space at the site.

“Kyneton doesn’t have an open space or town gathering area in the town centre in the way Lancefield or
Woodend does, and that still needs to be the overall vision supported,” he said.

Mr Steel told the Leader Windarring operated under the new NDIS model, which demanded it be run like a
business.

“If the State Government is fair dinkum about selling the school then we are in the market,” Mr Steel said.

“There is no agenda, we want activity at the site and our primary objective is to support positive outcomes for
our people.” Community consultation on the proposals continues until April 18.Details:
