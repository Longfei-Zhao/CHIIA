Saputo	completes	$1bn	acquisition	of	Murray
Goulburn

Published	01	May	2018
Canadian	dairy	producer	Saputo	has	completed	its	CAD1.29bn	($1.01bn)	acquisition	of	Australian	dairy	giant	Murray
Goulburn	Co-Operative.

The	purchase	price	of	CDN$1.29	billion	(A$1.31	billion),	on	a	debt-free	basis,	was	financed	through	a	newly	committed
bank	loan.

MG	produces	a	full	range	of	high-quality	dairy	foods,	including	drinking	milk,	milk	powder,	cheese,	butter	and	dairy
beverages,	as	well	as	a	range	of	ingredient	and	nutritional	products,	such	as	infant	formula.

MG	supplies	the	retail	and	foodservice	industries	globally	with	its	flagship	Devondale,	Liddells	and	Murray	Goulburn
Ingredients	brands.

After	taking	into	account	the	future	divestment	of	the	Koroit	plant	by	Saputo	in	accordance	with	its	undertaking	in
favour	of	the	Australian	Competition	and	Consumer	Commission,	Murray	Goulburn	operates	seven	manufacturing
facilities	across	Australia	and	one	in	China,	and	has	approximately	1,900	employees.

For	the	twelve-month	period	ended	on	June	30,	2017,	MG	had	revenues	of	approximately	CDN$2.5	billion	(A$2.5	billion)
and	earnings	before	interest,	taxes,	depreciation,	amortization,	milk	supply	support	package	forgiveness,	rationalisation
costs,	write-downs	and	non-recurring	costs	of	approximately	CDN$78	million	(A$79	million).

The	acquisition	of	Murray	Goulburn	will	add	to	and	complement	the	activities	of	the	Company's	Dairy	Division
(Australia).

By	acquiring	a	well-established	industry	player,	Saputo	reinforces	its	commitment	to	strengthen	its	presence	in	the
Australian	market.

The	Company	intends	to	continue	to	invest	in	its	existing	Australian	platform	and	contribute	to	the	ongoing
development	of	its	domestic	and	international	business.

Moelis	Australia	acted	as	financial	advisor	to	Saputo,	while	Ash	St.	Partners	Pty	Ltd	and	Clayton	Utz	acted	as	legal
counsel.	National	Bank	Financial	and	BMO	Capital	Markets	were	co-lead	arrangers	and	joint	bookrunners.
