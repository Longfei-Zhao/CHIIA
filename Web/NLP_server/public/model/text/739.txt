FN Media Group Presents USA News Group News Commentary

In a boon for lithium power, researchers have built a prototype lithium ion battery that could last 30 to 50
percent longer than any battery on the market. The news comes at a time when demand for lithium supplies
are now forecasting a shortfall as early as the end of 2018.

Lithium companies are benefiting from the push for global competition including NRG Metals Inc. (TSX: NGZ)
(OTC: NRGMF), Pilbara Minerals Ltd (OTC: PILBF), Neo Lithium Corporation (TSX: NLC) (OTC: NTTHF),
and Galaxy Resources (OTC: GALXF).

The limitations in capacity and longevity have held back electric vehicle adoption for many years and only
significant progress in addressing these issues has finally brought about the current breakthroughs. Apple
have been subject to public embarrassment following revelations that they intentionally slowed down old
phones in order to make them keep up with degrading batteries. Upcoming research developments could
help to overcome these problems once and for all and lead to even faster proliferation of lithium batteries.

One new source for lithium may be NRG Metals Inc. (TSX: NGZ) (OTCMKTS: NRGMF). That junior miner is
developing potentially huge lithium brine project in South America's well known lithium triangle. The lithium
trend also has other major lithium miners working full speed in order to bring on greater supplies of the
valuable metal including Pilbara Minerals Ltd (OTC: PILBF), Neo Lithium Corporation (TSX: NLC) (OTCQX:
NTTHF), and Galaxy Resources (OTC: GALXF).

Virtually all lithium-focused producers are seeing heightened activity and price rises at this point.

LONGER LIFE LITHIUM WOULD BE A HELP

The obvious downside to the new lithium driven energy boom is battery life. But new advancements to
prolong li-ion battery life are really changing the landscape. One of the notable developments is at the
University of Akron, where researchers have built a prototype for a lithium ion battery that could last 30 to 50
percent longer than any battery on the market.

The lead researcher on the project Dr. Yu Zhu explains that the improvements come from the materials that
bind the electrodes together. In conventional batteries where polymer binding material is used, the cells only
last for 10 to 20 cycles. With the new prototype, the battery can cycle for thousands of cycles without
depleting in capacity. The technology used in Zhu's project is a groundbreaking development given that little
has changed in li-ion technology for the past three decades.

The developers hope to scale up their prototype, which at the moment is the size of a coin, so that it can be
used in smartphones and other bigger applications. The Akron battery could hit the market in as little as two
years, but the market will not be short of competitors.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research are working on a li-ion battery that
could double current storage capacity and lower the weight of the battery. At the Northwestern University, in
collaboration with Argonne National Labs, researchers are hoping for a breakthrough on a rechargeable
battery, which may be capable of extending cellphone battery life by a factor of eight. The efficiency

ones Tesla has unveiled in Australia and Puerto Rico.

MOVING TO MEET DEMAND: JUNIORS CATCH THE WAVE

This unique climate has created a significant opportunity for all lithium companies. A likely scenario that will
become increasingly popular over the next few years is direct investment into junior lithium exploration
companies. One of the early movers in that category is NRG Metals - A Canadian company committed to
creating lithium resources.

NRG Metals, a start-up focused on the development of lithium brine assets in Argentina, has recently
attracted a Chinese battery material producer through closing on a $1.4 million private placement to fund
ongoing exploration activities in Argentina and the potential, as an Off-Take producer, for future lithium
products extracted. The company has two projects, with the most significant project being the "Hombre
Muerto North Project" or HMNP. HMNP is located in the Salta and Catamarca provinces and comprises a
total property package of over 3,000 hectares encompassing six concessions.

The company has reported good surface sample collections, magnesium to lithium ratios, and is located
across from Galaxy Resources' Sal de Vida lithium development project. Most importantly, the project is
within 20km of FMC Corporation's well established Fenix lithium brine project. With an offtake agreement of
this kind, it's possible that NRG Metals will sell lithium before it's even mined or at least provide a great asset
value to the company.

LONGER LIFE LITHIUM NOT ENOUGH TO STEM THE TIDE

While the new battery innovations by the Akron Researchers and others are making huge strides in the
quality and longevity of lithium battery technology, they are not near enough to offset the future need for
lithium that is driving development. All these innovations, if they make it to market, are likely to lead to even
higher acceptance rates of li-ion batteries.

And with lithium supplies already tight, the expected increase in demand will need massive infrastructure
investment from mining concerns and juniors to bring more supply online. Increases in the price of lithium
should continue to make such investments economically viable. In the process, investors in lithium mining
activities stand to reap the gains, with lithium expected by some leading analysts to be bigger than copper by
2030.

POTENTIAL COMPARABLES

Pilbara Minerals Ltd (OTC: PILBF)

Pilbara Minerals is an emerging lithium and tantalum producer focused on the development of its world-class
100% owned Pilgangoora Lithium-Tantalum Project, located approximately 120kms from Port Hedland in the
Pilbara region of Western Australia. Pilgangoora has been confirmed as one of the largest spodumene
(lithium pyroxene) and tantalite projects in the world and is set to be developed into one of the world's largest
lithium mines, also producing tantalite as a valuable by-product.

Neo Lithium Corporation (TSX: NLC) (OTCQX: NTTHF)

Neo Lithium Corp. engages in the exploration and development of resource properties. The company
explores for lithium deposits. It holds interests in the 3Q Project comprising 10 mining claims covering
approximately 35,000 hectares located in Tinogasta area, Catamarca province, Argentina. The company has
filed a Technical Report with Positive PEA Results on its 3Q Project Showing a Capital Cost reduction of
US$98.5M. The company was incorporated in 2016 and is based in Toronto, Canada.

Galaxy Resources (OTC: GALXF)

Galaxy Resources Limited is a lithium-focused resources company, with assets spanning Australia, Canada
