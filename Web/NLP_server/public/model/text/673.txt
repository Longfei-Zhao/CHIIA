who	has	just	landed	in	London!	•••	Just	touched	down	in	chilly	London
and	couldn’t	be	more	proud	of	@drewbilbe	and	our	team	at	@nexba.	It’s
been	7	epic	years	and	we	are	more	energised	than	ever	as	we	prepare	to
deliver	our	#naturallysugarfree	goodness	to	the	world.	Plenty	of	obstacles
ahead	undoubtedly,	but	life	is	best	lived	when	challenged	and	let’s	be
honest	great	change	shouldn’t	feel	comfy.	Time	to	tackle	diabetes	and
obesity	head	on	by	making	@Nexba	available	beyond	Australia.	Looking
forward	to	a	couple	of	weeks	in	London,	meeting	incredible	people	and
retailers	on	the	way.	Thanks	everyone	–	Let’s	do	this:).	Xx
