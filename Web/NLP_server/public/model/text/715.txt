SINGAPORE’S Chip Eng Seng Corporation has completed its $43 million acquisition of the Mercure & Ibis
Styles Grosvenor Hotel as foreign investors continue to circle Adelaide’s property market.

The deal settled last week, and is the Singapore group’s second hotel buy in Australia after its earlier
acquisition of the 84-room Sebel Mandurah in Perth for $15 million.

The Adelaide hotel has 245 guest rooms, comprising 181 rooms operated under the Mercure brand and 64
economy rooms run as Ibis Styles.

It is operated by Accor, with other facilities including the Federal Restaurant and Bar, conference rooms and
function space.

JLL SA managing director Jamie Guerra, who brokered the deal, said the sale campaign attracted more than
100 inquiries, with bids received from Singapore, China, local private investors and interstate funds.

“Interest from overseas and interstate was driven from the value-add opportunity of the location with
significant infrastructure spend in the North Tce precinct,” he said. “CEL Development (a division of Chip Eng
Seng) plans to take over the hotel and review the future redevelopment longer term.” JLL took the property to
the international market last year, noting its strategic 3794sq m site, which offered a range of redevelopment
options. The hotel’s retail component, fronting Hindley St, was marketed as an option for major
redevelopment.The property, pictured right, was upgraded in 2013.
