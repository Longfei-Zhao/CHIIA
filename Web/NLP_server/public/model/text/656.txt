Baby food supplier Bubs Australia’s is charging ahead after the acquisition of goat milk products maker
NuLac Foods helped bring about a fivefold increase in the group’s latest quarterly sales figures.

Bubs yesterday said its third-quarter net sales grew by 422 per cent to $5.2 million, compared to a year ago.

The lift in revenue came from both the Bubs business and NuLac Foods, which completed its first full quarter
of trading under Bubs ownership. Sales of goat milk infant formula were up by 63 per cent.

Bubs bought NuLac for $39m last November.

“We continue to make solid progress on our strategic journey to increase domestic penetration of our product
range, and expand channel capability into China,” Bubs chief executive Nicholas Simms told the market.
Bub’s third-quarter sales to China rose by 55 per cent.

“Our penetration into China’s cross-border e-commerce channel continues to develop, most notably with our
entering an international supply agreement with Chinese online giant JD.com,” Mr Simms said.

Bubs said all three stages of its goat milk infant formula were to be sold in Woolworths stores starting this
month, and some varieties of organic baby cereals would start to appear in Woolworths in May.

Chemist Warehouse will start to sell some varieties of Bubs organic baby food pouches in its stores in April.

Bubs said its new-look branding launched last year was being well received. Bubs shares closed at their
highest level in a month — up 9.2 per cent to 83c apiece.AAP
