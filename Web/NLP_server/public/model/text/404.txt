■ PRICES for industrial sites in the southeast are soaring at the same time that sales volumes have doubled
so far this year, according to Cushman Wakefield.

The agency recently sold two Clayton South properties for Peter Fountas’ Virtus Property Group for a
combined $23.05 million.

A 23,785sq m site at 90 Whiteside Rd was bought by a local developer for $15.5 million — a land rate of
$654 per square metre, which the agency said was a record for properties under 3 hectares in that suburb.
Returning rent of $688,027, the deal reflected a yield of 4.4 per cent.

The other property at 103-113 Fairbank Rd was bought for $7.55 million by Chinese investors. It comprises
9981sq m across six subdivided lots.

Industrial property sales in Melbourne’s southeast and east more than doubled to $622 million in the first
three months of 2018 compared with the same quarter last year, according to Cushman Wakefield. “In the
southeast alone, rolling annual volumes increased 68 per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2018 to
$456 million,” the agency said.

NEW-LOOK WEST END ■ THE transformation of the western end of the CBD might gathering pace after 601
Bourke St was put on the market by the Farmer family.

Although the tenanted 12-level office building has a weighted average lease expiry of 5.6 years, agency
CBRE believes the site has scope for further development.

“It would suit a variety of long-term options, including a strata selldown or the development of additional
floors, subject to the relevant planning approvals,” Josh Rutman said.

CBRE’s expressions of interest campaign closes on April 26. Agent Mark Wizel said it had already received
early interest around the $60 million-mark.
