Norwood-based Minotaur Exploration (ASX: MEP) announced today that it has signed a binding agreement
with a company interested in buying its nickel tenements E36/899, E37/909 and E36/936 located south-east
of Leinster in Western Australia.

A corporate a press release reveals that, under the terms of the Tenement Sale Agreement, the exploration
company should receive A$50,000 in cash and paid upfront, shares in the new nickel vehicle to the value of
A$1 million, and A$500,000 in cash payable upon mining within the Leinster tenements. In other words,
Minotaur will retain its exposure to discovery potential through equity in the to-be-listed acquisition entity.

According to the miner`s website, the Leinster Nickel Project is located in granites and greenstones of the
Achaean Kalgoorlie Terrane and its tenements host known deposits of nickel sulphides and gold
mineralisation.

Minotaur says that the sale will allow management to focus its regional attention on the Saints nickel
resource, 65 kilometres northwest of Kalgoorlie, where an in-fill EM survey has just concluded.

Although nickel has been gaining momentum since it is needed to make lithium-ion batteries for electric
vehicles, a BMI report says refined nickel prices will go down in the coming months because, in its
researchers` view, EV production expectations are overly optimistic while, at the same time, Indonesia is
oversupplying the market and China`s demand has subdued.
