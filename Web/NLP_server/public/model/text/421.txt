About Starpharma

Starpharma Holdings Limited (ASX: SPL, OTCQX:SPHRY), located in Melbourne Australia, is an ASX 300 company and is a world leader in the development of
dendrimer products for pharmaceutical, life science and other applications.

Starpharma's underlying technology is built around dendrimers – a type of synthetic nanoscale polymer that is highly regular in size and structure and well suited
to pharmaceutical and medical uses.  Starpharma has two core development programs: VivaGel® portfolio and DEP® drug delivery with the Company developing
a number of products internally and others via commercial partnerships.

VivaGel®: Starpharma's portfolio includes women's health products based on VivaGel® (SPL7013, astodrimer sodium), a proprietary dendrimer.  VivaGel® BV is
approved for marketing in the EU and Australia for bacterial vaginosis (BV). Starpharma has a license agreement with Aspen Pharmacare Australia Pty Ltd for the
sales and marketing of VivaGel® BV in Australia and New Zealand. Starpharma has also developed an antiviral condom which uses VivaGel® in the lubricant,
which is available in Australia and Canada under the Lifestyles® Dual Protect™ brand. Starpharma has a number of license agreements to market the VivaGel®
condom in other regions, including China and Japan (Okamoto).

DEP® - Dendrimer Enhanced Product®: Starpharma's DEP® drug delivery platform has demonstrated reproducible preclinical benefits across multiple internal
and partnered DEP® programs, including improved efficacy, safety and survival. Starpharma has two internal DEP® products – DEP® docetaxel and DEP®
cabazitaxel - in clinical development in patients with solid tumours, and further DEP® products approaching clinical development. Starpharma's partnered DEP®
programs include a multiproduct DEP® licence with AstraZeneca, which involves the development and commercialisation of two novel oncology compounds, with
potential to add more.
