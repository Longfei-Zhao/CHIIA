GRAND	PLAN:	Several	major	projects	are	part	of	a	plan	to	revitalise	the	heart	of	Bendigo.

THE	2018	budget	funds	the	beginning	of	a	plan	to	revitalise	Bendigo’s	CBD,	particularly	the	northern	end.

The	City	of	Greater	Bendigo,	Regional	Development	Victoria	and	various	industry	groups	have	been	working	together	to	bring	more	people	into	the	heart	of	the	city	–	but	to	do	so	requires
several	significant	projects	to	fall	into	place.

Last	year’s	budget	suggested	election-year	promises	would	come	in	relation	to	the	Bendigo	law	courts,	with	a	2017-18	commitment	of	$3.9	million	to	“develop	plans	to	address	current	and
future	demand	pressures	so	cases	can	be	heard	sooner”.

Also	provided	was	$1	million	for	Bendigo	to	develop	a	proposal	to	“consolidate	Victorians	public	service	and	council	functions	and	agencies	into	a	new	customer	service	centre”.	It	was	a
planning	budget	–	and	this	year,	the	next	pieces	of	the	puzzle	have	been	put	in	place.

An	artist	impression	of	the	new	Bendigo	TAFE	from	Chapel	Street.

Bendigo	TAFE	chief	executive	Trevor	Schwenke	is	correct	when	he	says	$59.9	million	for	a	new-look	city	campus	is	a	game-changer	and	will	‘boost	activity	in	the	northern	part	of	Bendigo’s
central	business	district’.

Not	only	will	Bendigo	have	a	state-of-the-art	facility	for	TAFE	students,	but	the	development	opens	the	door	for	a	portion	of	the	site	to	be	used	for	other	purposes.

The	TAFE’s	city	campus	has	been	identified	as	the	preferred	site	for	new	law	courts	for	Bendigo	–	and	this	week’s	budget	includes	funding	for	the	acquisition	of	land	for	a	new	court	facility.

Court	Services	Victoria	said	in	January	it	was	in	negotiations	to	use	a	portion	of	the	McCrae	Street	campus	for	a	10	courtroom	facility	by	mid-2022,	complete	with	mediation	suites,	interview
rooms	and	safe	waiting	areas.

Part	of	the	precinct	is	TAFE	land,	while	some	is	still	privately	owned.

Bendigo	and	Werribee	will	share	in	$20	million	for	acquiring	land	for	new	courts	–	so	it’s	reasonable	to	assume	some	of	that	will	be	spent	in	the	current	TAFE	precinct.

City	of	Greater	Bendigo	mayor	Margaret	O’Rourke	is	pleased	with	Bendigo’s	financial	allocations	in	the	2018	state	budget,	but	remains	hopeful	of	further	funding	commitments	in	an	election
year.

Voters	head	to	the	polls	in	November,	with	law	and	order	issues	expected	to	be	a	focus	for	the	Liberal	Party,	who	recently	announced	police	officer	Ian	Ellis	as	candidate	for	Bendigo	East.

Cr	O’Rourke	isn’t	surprised	with	what	was	funded	this	week	for	the	new	law	courts,	as	there	are	“a	number	of	areas	that	need	to	be	pulled	together	in	such	a	large	project”.	

“We're	all	confident	it	will	be	happening,”	Cr	O’Rourke	says,	adding	the	council	will	seek	a	firm	commitment	from	the	Labor	and	Liberal	parties	on	fully	funding	the	law	courts	before	the
election.

Relocating	the	law	courts	is	a	vital	part	of	the	plan	for	the	heart	of	Bendigo.

Funding	has	been	allocated	to	purchase	land	for	new	law	courts.

The	plan	will	see	the	TAFE	and	law	courts	bookend	the	northern	part	of	the	CBD,	in	a	precinct	which	then	circles	around	to	the	new	GovHub	on	the	site	of	the	current	City	of	Greater	Bendigo
offices	in	Lyttleton	Terrace.	

The	GovHub	will	bring	1000	public	sector	jobs	central	Bendigo.

The	precinct	then	crosses	to	Bendigo	Marketplace	and	Bendigo	Railway	Station,	down	to	Bendigo	Bank,	along	the	View	Street	arts	precinct	and	around	to	the	Golden	Dragon	Museum.

Funding	for	the	Golden	Dragon	Museum	to	develop	a	dedicated	Chinese	cultural	centre	and	the	terminal	building	and	utilities	extension	at	Bendigo	airport	was	not	forthcoming,	but	council
plans	to	continue	to	advocate	for	these	commitments.	It	is	hoped	the	revitalisation	and	increased	foot	traffic	in	the	centre	of	Bendigo	will	also	bring	new	energy	and	investment	into	Hargreaves
Mall.

Member	for	Bendigo	East	Jacinta	Allan	says	that	‘as	the	new	Bendigo	Hospital	project	comes	to	a	completion	with	stage	two	finishing	soon,	this	budget	provides	funds	for	projects	that	will
revitalise	the	heart	of	Bendigo’.

“Not	everything	gets	funded	in	the	budget	but	we	will	continue	to	work	hard	on	other	projects,”	she	says.	“It’s	good	to	see	the	treasurer	and	the	premier	support	these	projects	for	Bendigo.	It’s
a	balanced	budget	that	supports	our	regional	centres.

“A	massive	re-build	of	Bendigo	Tafe’s	central	city	campus,	the	GovHub,	land	for	new	Bendigo	Law	Courts	will	create	construction	jobs	in	and	around	Bendigo.’’

Member	for	Bendigo	West	Maree	Edwards	believes	the	influx	of	workers	and	students	in	the	Bendigo	area	will	breathe	a	new	lease	of	life	into	the	CBD.

“More	workers	and	more	students	will	be	in	the	Bendigo	CBD.	This	will	support	our	retail	and	hospitality	industry,’’	she	says.	“The	budget	confirms	our	on-going	investment	in	schools,	roads
and	bus	services	that	support	local	families.”

Cr	O’Rourke	is	similarly	positive,	especially	on	aspects	designed	to	improve	the	vitality	of	the	CBD.

“The	TAFE	funding	is	excellent,	it	fits	into	the	broader	picture	of	revitalising	the	city	centre,”	she	says.

The	Liberal	party	candidate	for	Bendigo	East,	Ian	Ellis,	has	been	contacted	for	comment.

The	Bendigo	Bank	will	bookend	the	CBD	precinct.

Deputy	leader	of	the	Nationals,	Steph	Ryan,	believes	the	state	government	has	left	it	until	six	months	before	an	election	to	show	an	interest	in	TAFE.

“Daniel	Andrews’	TAFE	rescue	has	been	a	miserable	failure	with	student	enrolments	crashing	by	more	than	150,000,’’	she	says.	“Now	in	an	election	year	he’s	announced	courses	will	be	free	in
a	desperate	bid	to	save	face	and	get	students	through	the	doors.	A	majority	of	Victoria’s	TAFEs	are	struggling	financially,	with	many	relying	on	government	bailouts	to	stay	afloat.

Making	TAFE	courses	free	has	the	potential	to	decimate	adult	education	providers	and	goes	against	the	advice	of	Labor’s	own	VET	funding	review	which	found	it	would	result	in	over
enrolments	in	some	areas	of	provision.’’

Shadow	attorney	general	John	Pesutto	says	the	state	budget	also	shows	court	costs	and	delays	have	blown	out.		“In	both	criminal	and	civil	cases	average	case	costs	in	the	Supreme,	County,
Magistrates’	and	Children’s	courts	have	increased	significantly,’’	he	says.		“In	nearly	all	of	these	courts,	average	case	costs	are	forecast	to	increase	even	further.	On	top	of	mounting	case	costs,
this	year’s	budget	shows	clearance	rates	and	timeliness	across	the	court	system	must	be	improved,	especially	in	the	Magistrates’	Court	where	capacity	constraints	are	becoming	clearer.”
