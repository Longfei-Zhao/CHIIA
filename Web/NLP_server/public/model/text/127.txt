AGL Energy says it is assessing an offer from Hong Kong-owned rival Alinta Energy for an ageing power
station in the Hunter Valley.

Alinta has offered $250 million for AGL’s Liddell power station. AGL confirmed yesterday that it had received
a non-binding and “highly conditional” cash offer from Alinta and its Hong Kong-based owner, Chow Tai Fook
Enterprises, for the plant.

The company said it was assessing the proposal but could give no assurance a deal would result.

It was reported yesterday that Alinta had made a bid totalling $1.2 billion for Liddell, in a move set to ramp up
pressure on AGL to either sell or reverse its controversial decision to shut down the coal-fired power station
by 2022. Alinta indicated the $1 billion-plus price could include the purchase price and capital investment in
the facility. Alinta said the offer was “a compelling commercial proposition for AGL shareholders”.

AGL has said previously it has not sought to sell Liddell, as it requires the plant to provide energy until 2022
and for repurposing as part of a new-generation plan after that date.

The Federal Government is keen for the station to remain open beyond its slated 2022 closure and has been
lobbying AGL to accept a sale.

Federal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg yesterday welcomed the announcement Alinta had put forward an
offer.“It’s important that AGL gives proper consideration to the offer, given Alinta’s stated intention to continue
operating the plant beyond 2022,” he said. “The Government is concerned about the impact on the reliability
and affordability of our energy system should Liddell close in 2022.”
